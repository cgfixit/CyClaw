# CLAUDE.md — CyClaw Operating Manual

This is the operating contract for every agent working in this repository. It is
written to be followed literally. Where a rule gives a number, use that number.
Where it says "never," there is no exception without explicit user approval.
Read it fully before acting. It **overrides** your default behavior.

If you do only one thing before editing: run
`python3 .claude/skills/invariant-guard/check_invariants.py` to learn the shape
of what must not break.

## 1. Read Me First

**What CyClaw is.** A Python 3.12 FastAPI RAG server (`gate.py`) fronting a
LangGraph security topology (`graph.py`), with hybrid ChromaDB + BM25 retrieval,
a local LLM via Ollama, and triple-gated optional external fallbacks (Grok
and/or Claude, selected per-query via `online_provider`). It binds
**only** to `127.0.0.1:8787`. A separate retrieval-only MCP server
(`mcp_hybrid_server.py`) exposes search with no LLM path. 

# Critical Python Coding Requirement:
- Never use docstrings as multi-line comments other than when placed at the beginning of a python file OR top of a defined function.
- When multi-line comments required outside of that context, just use a # at the beginning of each line of the comment


**Where truth lives.** In priority order:
1. **Code** — the running behavior. When docs and code disagree, code wins.
2. **`config.yaml`** — the single source of truth for every tunable. No
   hardcoded tunables anywhere else.
3. **`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`** — the security scope: trusted-operator (one
   by default, a small mutually trusted set behind `auth.enabled`),
   loopback-bound, single-tenant. Multi-operator is not multi-tenant (fifteenth
   amendment); not a sandbox for untrusted code. Read it before touching
   anything security-related.
4. This file and `.claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md` — the operating rules.
   `AGENTS.md` is the parallel guidance for other agents; keep them consistent.
5. `README.md` for holistic view of codebase and purpose of application — `docs/changelog.txt` for reference of changes over time.

`retrieve` is the unconditional first node. Routing is graph edges, never an LLM

### All HTTP routes (gate.py)

| Method | Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | none | serves `static/terminal.html` |
| GET | `/static/*` | none | static mount |
| POST | `/query` | **session or device token when `auth.enabled`**; **same-origin always** | rate-limited, sanitized; cross-site rejected (403 `CROSS_SITE_BLOCKED`) regardless of `auth.enabled`, and a request carrying neither `Origin` nor `Sec-Fetch-Site` is allowed; the `audit` role is denied (403 `AUTH_ROLE_DENIED`); 400/401/403/429/503/504/500. Unchanged (no credential) when auth is off |
| GET | `/health` | none | `degraded` without Ollama is NORMAL |
| POST | `/index/build` | **loopback peer + same-origin** | rate-limited; audited; starts a background index build; 409 while one is running. Deliberately NOT API-key gated — an unset `CYCLAW_API_KEY` fails closed, which would brick first-run |
| GET | `/index/status` | none | **not** rate-limited (the console polls it every 1.5s for the length of a build — 40 of the 60/min budget; same posture as `/health`); always 200 + `{state, elapsed_sec, chunks_done, chunks_total, error, index_ready}` |
| GET | `/soul` | **API key** | rate-limited |
| POST | `/soul/propose` | **API key** | advisory scan, never writes |
| POST | `/soul/apply` | **API key** | enforced scan + atomic write; requires `reason` |
| POST | `/soul/reload` | **API key** | |
| POST | `/soul/restore` | **API key** | from `.bak` |
| GET | `/audit/summary` | **API key** | rate-limited; aggregates only, no raw queries |

| POST | `/auth/bootstrap-password` | loopback peer, no forwarding headers | first admin password; same-origin; 403 off-box or when proxied; 409 once set; 503 when auth off |
| POST | `/auth/login` | none | rate-limited; session cookie + CSRF token on success; 503 when `auth.enabled` is false |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | **session cookie + CSRF** | rate-limited; 503 when `auth.enabled` is false |
| GET | `/auth/whoami` | **session cookie or bearer token** | rate-limited; returns `username` + `role`; 503 when `auth.enabled` is false |
| GET | `/auth/users` | **session; admin or operator** | list users, no hashes; 503 when auth off |
| POST | `/auth/users` | **session+CSRF or admin bearer** | create user; operator cannot create admin |
| POST | `/auth/password` | **session+CSRF or admin bearer** | self-service password change; any authenticated role |
| POST | `/auth/users/{username}/password` | **session+CSRF or admin bearer** | reset password; operator cannot touch admins |
| POST | `/auth/users/{username}/role` | **admin only** | set role; last-admin protected |
| POST | `/auth/users/{username}/disable` `/auth/users/{username}/enable` | **admin; operator on non-admins** | last-admin protected |
| DELETE | `/auth/users/{username}` | **admin only** | hard delete after revoke; last-admin protected |
| GET | `/auth/audit/summary` | **session; admin or audit** | reduced audit view; not the ops API key |
| GET | `/memory/status` | **API key** | rate-limited; always 200 + flags (default-off memory) |
| GET | `/memory/facts` | **API key** | rate-limited; 404 when `memory.enabled` is false |
| GET | `/memory/episodes` | **API key** | rate-limited; 404 when `memory.enabled` is false |
| GET | `/memory/proposals` | **API key** | rate-limited; 404 when propose/apply off |
| POST | `/memory/propose` | **API key** | rate-limited; requires non-empty `reason` |
| POST | `/memory/apply` | **API key** | rate-limited; reason + injection scan on apply |
| POST | `/memory/reject` | **API key** | rate-limited; requires non-empty `reason` |
| GET | `/query/export/html` | **API key** | rate-limited; 404 when `export_html.enabled` is false |

The four `/ops/*` endpoints reach out-of-band subsystems ONLY through
`utils/ops_runner.py` (a `subprocess.run([...])` shim). They never import those
subsystems.

Every route marked **API key** above is gated by `gate.py`'s
`require_api_key`. `config.yaml`'s
`security.api_key_optional` (default `false`) is the one deliberate bypass. It
does **not** touch the separate session/RBAC `/auth/*` system below, which
stays governed by `auth.enabled` regardless. Two controls bound it:

**Per-request (the primary one):** `gate.py`'s `_api_key_bypass_allowed` requires
**four** conditions, every one necessary — the flag is set; the request's
**socket peer is loopback**; **no reverse-proxy forwarding header** is present
(a proxy on this host makes every remote caller present a loopback peer); and
the request is **not cross-site** (a page the operator visits is a loopback peer
too, and a CORS-simple POST executes before CORS withholds the response). Do not
read the loopback check as the whole control — the function's own docstring notes
each condition closes a hole the previous ones left. A remote caller always needs
the real key regardless of how the process was launched, including
`uvicorn gate:app --host 0.0.0.0` (the container's own `CMD`), which runs no
bind guard. Keyed on the
peer, never the `Host` header (`TrustedHostMiddleware` is a DNS-rebinding
control, not authentication) and never `security.allowed_hosts`/`allowed_origins`
(those filter headers on requests that already arrived and open no socket).

**At bind (defence in depth):** `gate.py`'s `_require_loopback_bind` refuses a
non-loopback `api.host` while the flag is `true`, including via the auth+TLS
route past loopback. `config-guard`'s C13 warns (does not fail) on that same
pair. `CYCLAW_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK_BIND` still outranks the bind guard (explicit
"I front this with my own auth"), but never the peer check. Note the flag is
inert under Docker: NAT rewrites the source, so the peer is the bridge gateway
and the routes stay key-gated — set `CYCLAW_API_KEY` in the container.

The original three `/auth/*` endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`,
`/auth/whoami`) were Stage 2 of `docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md`
(`gate_auth.py`, registered the same way `gate_ops.py` registers `/ops/*`).
Every `/auth/*` handler — including the RBAC/admin routes `gate_auth.py` has
since grown (`docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md` §12 "Roles") — exists regardless
of `auth.enabled` and checks the flag first, returning 503 rather than 404, so
a route's mere presence never discloses whether the feature is on. The full
route set (login/logout/whoami, the `/auth/users*` admin/RBAC routes,
self-service `/auth/password`, and `/auth/audit/summary`) is in the route
table above. **Stage 3** attaches `require_session_or_token` to `POST /query`
when `auth.enabled` is the literal boolean `true` (session cookie or named
device token; no CSRF on `/query`). The shipped default leaves `/query`
unauthenticated.

The `/memory/*` and `/query/export/html` endpoints are the optional memory
subsystem (`gate_memory.py` + package `memory/`, plan in
`docs/memory/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`). Every `memory:` switch ships **false** —
handlers return 404 (or 200 + `enabled: false` for `/memory/status`) until an
operator enables them. Mutating routes require Bearer `CYCLAW_API_KEY` and a
non-empty `reason`, with injection scan on apply (parallel to soul I5, not
overloading soul). Episode staging and FTS fusion hooks are lazy and non-fatal.

### Key modules

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `gate.py` | FastAPI entry, auth, rate limit, sanitizer, security headers, telemetry kill |
| `utils/telemetry_kill.py` | The canonical maps — `TELEMETRY_KILL` (21 telemetry pairs), a visibly-separate `UPDATE_CHECK_OPT_OUT` (4 ancillary pairs), and `SCRUBBED_ENV_KEYS` (5 tracing credentials + the 2 declarative-OTel config names, removed outright) — plus `apply_telemetry_kill()`, the pure child builder `build_telemetry_safe_env(base)`, `scheduler_env_overlay()` for generated jobs, and the launcher CLI `python -m utils.telemetry_kill --export {shell,powershell}`. Applied at import by every maintained chokepoint (invariant-guard G1 pins 14 orderings) and delivered as literal env by Docker/launchers/generators. Stdlib-only on purpose — it loads ahead of everything heavy; the ONNX API half deliberately lives in `utils/onnx_telemetry.py` instead. Deliberately excludes `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`/`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` — see `retrieval/embeddings.py` |
| `utils/onnx_telemetry.py` | `suppress_onnx_telemetry()` — the post-import ONNX Runtime API suppression (`disable_telemetry_events()`), getattr-guarded, idempotent, absent-safe; called at the two load seams (`retrieval/vector_store.py`, `guardrails/integration.py` with `force_import=True` before `LLMRails`). Env half (`ORT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`) rides the kill map |
| `gate_ops.py` | The four `/ops/*` endpoints, registered onto gate.py's app with its auth/rate-limit/audit callables injected; never imports `sync`/`agentic` |
| `gate_auth.py` | The `/auth/*` endpoint set — Stage 2's login/logout/whoami plus the RBAC/admin routes it has since grown (`docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md`; the full list is in the route table above) — registered onto gate.py's app the same way `gate_ops.py` registers `/ops/*`. Session cookie + CSRF for browsers, bearer device tokens for programmatic clients; Stage 3 attaches `require_session_or_token` to `/query` by name (`_AUTH_DEPENDENCY_NAME`) only when `auth_manager` is not None |
| `gate_memory.py` | Optional default-off memory admin surface (`/memory/*` + `/query/export/html`), registered onto gate.py's app the same way `gate_ops.py`/`gate_auth.py` register their routes. Lazy-imports package `memory` only inside handlers; never OOB. See `docs/memory/README.md` |
| `memory/` | Optional facts + episodes SQLite+FTS5 store with propose/apply governance and optional retrieval fusion (all switches false in shipped `config.yaml`) |
| `graph.py` | 12-node LangGraph topology; all security policy lives in the edges |
| `retrieval/hybrid_search.py` | RRF fusion (k=60) over ChromaDB + BM25 |
| `retrieval/indexer.py` | Corpus ingestion, chunk sanitization (`cyclaw-index`) |
| `retrieval/embeddings.py` | Local embeddings, device hardcoded to CPU (`EMBED_DEVICE` — cross-platform determinism; see the constant's own comment for why); triple `lru_cache`; `embedding_fingerprint()` for index-staleness detection |
| `retrieval/stemmer.py` | Porter stemmer + custom vocab; avoids NLTK punkt (CVE) |
| `retrieval/vector_store.py` | Pluggable reader/writer: embedded ChromaDB (default) or pgvector |
| `retrieval/clear_cache.py` | Dry-run-by-default embedding-cache cleaner (`cyclaw-clear-cache`) |
| `llm/client.py` | `LocalLLMClient` + `GrokClient` + `ClaudeClient`; shared bounded-retry `_post_with_retry`, which honors `Retry-After` and reads a per-request graph-deadline ContextVar (`set_graph_deadline`, set by `gate.py`'s `/query`) so every POST is capped at the remaining `api.graph_timeout_sec` budget and a retry whose backoff would overrun it is refused (#1359) |
| `utils/sanitizer.py` | Injection filter; patterns in `config.yaml` |
| `utils/personality.py` | Soul versioning, SHA-256 drift detection, injection gate on write |
| `utils/personality_db.py` | Soul DB backend: SQLite default, Postgres via `CYCLAW_DB_URL` |
| `utils/logger.py` | Audit JSONL; SHA-256 query hashing, recursive PII redaction. Since the Numbat mainline plane landed, `audit_log` also projects each **already-redacted** record into the derived NDJSON stream via a lazy, fail-soft `utils/numbat_emitter` call — `audit.jsonl` stays authoritative |
| `utils/numbat_emitter.py` | Derived Numbat NDJSON stream (`logs/numbat-events.ndjsonl`, `numbat:` block ships **enabled**). Two producer planes: the out-of-band **action** plane (`emit_numbat_event`/`emit_numbat_command` from `agentic/*` + `ops_runner`) and the **mainline** plane (`project_audit_record`, every audit record). Events that already emit directly are listed in `_AUDIT_ACTION_PLANE_EVENTS` so they aren't written twice — keep that set in step with the emit sites. Stdlib-only and fail-soft on purpose: it is lazy-imported *inside* gate/graph processes on every `audit_log`, so it must never raise |
| `utils/ratelimit.py` | Per-IP rate limiting; in-memory / SQLite / Postgres |
| `utils/health.py` | `check_all()` behind `/health`; probes Grok/Claude only when `api.health_probe_external_providers` is true (ships **false** — `/health` is unauthenticated and unrate-limited, so probing there is operator-triggerable third-party egress), and even then skips a provider whose key is unset |
| `utils/errors.py` | Typed exception hierarchy rooted at `RAGError` |
| `utils/config_validation.py` | Boot-time config validation; fails fast |
| `utils/ops_runner.py` | Subprocess shim behind the four `/ops/*` endpoints |
| `utils/guardrail_bridge.py` | Inversion shim: builds the `guardrail_input` and `guardrail_output` nodes' callables, or `None` for either when disabled; the only module through which `graph.py` reaches `guardrails/` (never a direct import) |
| `utils/authn.py` | Per-user authentication primitives (`docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md`): scrypt password hash/verify, per-account lockout arithmetic, session/CSRF/device-token id generation. Pure functions, no DB, no HTTP |
| `utils/authn_store.py` | SQLite/Postgres backend for `users`/`sessions`/`device_tokens`, mirroring `utils/personality_db.py`'s `connect()` pattern; own `CYCLAW_AUTH_DB_URL` env var, deliberately not shared with personality's `CYCLAW_DB_URL` |
| `utils/authn_manager.py` | `AuthManager` — ties `utils/authn.py` + `utils/authn_store.py` together: bootstrap, login/logout, session validation, device-token CRUD. No HTTP awareness; `gate_auth.py` is the only caller that knows about cookies/headers/status codes |
| `utils/authn_cli.py` | `cyclaw-user` console script (`add`/`list`/`disable`/`enable`/`passwd`/`token create`/`token list`/`token revoke`), local-only by construction (no HTTP route reaches it) |
| `utils/gen_cert.py` | `cyclaw-gen-cert` — openssl wrapper that writes a self-signed cert + key with hostname/LAN SAN; no new runtime dep |
| `schemas/api.py` | Pydantic models (`extra='forbid', strict=True`) |
| `metrics.py` | `audit.jsonl` analyzer (`cyclaw-metrics`); also prints a Spend section from `logs/spend.jsonl` (tokens as ground truth, dollars at read time, `source` `query` or `agentic`; no query text on the ledger) and an offline Sequences section (`utils/sequence_detect.py`) joining hashed audit events to `source=query` spend. Forensic/CLI only — not imported by `gate.py`/`graph.py`/MCP and not a `/query` policy point |
| `mcp_hybrid_server.py` | MCP server: `hybrid_search` only, no LLM, `sampling: None` |
| `sync/` | Out-of-band Dropbox corpus sync (`python -m sync.cli`) |
| `agentic/` | Out-of-band GitHub context + governed skills registry (`python -m agentic.cli`) |
| `agentic/fsconnect/` | Out-of-band local/SMB filesystem connector; POSIX held-fd security core; macOS installer enables list/stat/read only for `~/CyClaw-FS` while writes/indexing stay off |
| `agentic/sqlconnect/` | Out-of-band SQL connector; SELECT/WITH-only guard |
| `agentic/netconnect/` | Out-of-band passive LAN inventory; explicit RFC1918/loopback CIDRs; local host + existing neighbor cache only, with no active probes |
| `agentic/real_repo_loop.py` | Plan → patch → verify → (human decides) → commit against a real jailed clone; the first live caller of `agentic/executor`. Wired to `agentic.cli`'s `real-repo-run`/`real-repo-run-status`/`real-repo-run-decide`; CLI-only (`utils/ops_runner.py` allowlists the actions, but `OpsAgenticRequest.action` does not accept them, so no HTTP route reaches the pipeline). `real-repo-run-plan` is a separate one-shot subcommand for the optional cloud-planner recipe (`ChatModelProposerClient` behind `--provider`/`--confirm-online`) — `--provider` means something different on each subcommand (one-shot plan call vs. every iteration of the whole loop); see `docs/agentic/AGENTIC_README.md` §9 for the two-stage "cloud plans, local implements" recipe and the gotcha of passing `--provider` to both. GitHub writes (push, PR) reachable via `real-repo-run-decide --push`/`--publish` (one-shot) or the standalone `real-repo-run-push`/`real-repo-run-publish` subcommands (each its own decision) — push/PR still gated (`allow_git_write_tools` ships false; `EXECUTION_ENABLED` is True but `agentic.enabled` ships false) — see `docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md` |
| `agentic/executor/` | Sandboxed verification: runs caller-declared checks (pytest/ruff/etc.) as argv-list subprocesses against a jailed worktree, scrubbed env, disposable `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`, per-check timeout. Every non-empty check list goes through `hard_sandbox.py`'s `production_sandbox()` (issue #1134 Phase 4) — Windows Job Object (`KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`), Darwin `sandbox-exec` (network and off-cwd writes denied), Linux `unshare --net` — and a missing binary or failed capability probe raises `HardSandboxUnavailable`. There is **no** silent fallback to unconstrained `subprocess.run`; `run_verification`'s `sandbox=` parameter is test-only. Still not a kernel boundary: no microVM, and Windows is a process-tree kill rather than a netns, so sockets keep working there — see `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`'s executor amendments for the residual limits |
| `agentic/deepagent_github/` | Two subsystems: the live one (`RepoWorkspaceTools`: clone/read/write_file/commit/push, jailed via `agentic/fsconnect/pathsafe.ScopedRoots`; `chat_client.py`/`model_adapter.py`, the cloud-provider planner `real_repo_loop.py` uses) and the **retired** one (`builder.py`'s DeepAgents subgraph — owner decision 2026-07-31, no further development planned, superseded by `real_repo_loop.py`; code/tests/CI kept, not deleted — see `docs/work/GITHUB_DEEP_AGENT_HARNESS_OPTIMIZER_PLAN.md`'s retirement note). Both gated `false`/disarmed by default |
| `guardrails/` | Optional NeMo Guardrails; soft-imported, disabled by default. Phase 2 wires an offline input rail into `graph.py`'s `guardrail_input` node when `enabled: true`; Phase 4 adds an offline output (grounding) rail via `guardrail_output`, scoped to the `local_llm` answer only — both via `utils/guardrail_bridge.py`, still opt-in, still never imported directly by `gate.py`/`graph.py` |
| `telegram/` | Out-of-band Telegram channel (`python -m telegram.cli`), shipped `enabled: false`. Outbound notify (`mode: notify`) and, when configured, long-poll inbound chat (`mode: chat`) via the Telegram Bot API; inbound text only ever becomes an answer through HTTP `POST /query` on loopback — never a direct call into `graph.py`. `gate.py`/`graph.py`/`mcp_hybrid_server.py` never import it (I6). T3 hybrid-confirm consent (`allow_hybrid_confirm`, default off) is the only way chat text can set `user_confirmed_online`, and only via the exact `/online on <grok|claude>` command — core's triple gate remains the final authority. T4 media staging (default off) writes only through the existing `agentic/fsconnect` write path. See `docs/channels/TELEGRAM_DESIGN.md` and `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`'s seventh amendment |
| `opentweet/` | Out-of-band OpenTweet X channel (`python -m opentweet.cli`), shipped `enabled: false`. Weekly generate-don't-load LaunchAgent / generate-don't-register Windows task. Generation is loopback `POST /query` with `user_confirmed_online: false`; default write is an OpenTweet draft; `scheduled_date` is opt-in. Never a graph node, never X/Tweepy, never hosted OpenTweet MCP. See `docs/channels/OPENTWEET_DESIGN.md` |

### Load-bearing numbers (all from `config.yaml`/`pyproject.toml` — do not invent)

| `grok-4.5` | `grok.model` | `grok.enabled: true` since 2026-08-07 (armed; see `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` eighth amendment) — still triple-gated (I3), `user_confirmed_online` is per-request and cannot be pre-set |

## 3. The Six Invariants

These define CyClaw. Five are enforced by graph topology; the sixth by import
structure. They are not prompts or runtime checks — they are wiring.
`python3 .claude/skills/invariant-guard/check_invariants.py` verifies all six
statically; run it after any change to the core files.

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Locked by test | You violate it if you… |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | **RAG-first** — `retrieve` is the unconditional entry; no LLM call precedes retrieval | `graph.py` `set_entry_point("retrieve")` | `test_graph` | add a node/edge that answers before `retrieve` runs |
| I2 | **Topology = policy** — routing is graph edges only, never an LLM or ad-hoc `if` | `graph.py` `score_router`/`guardrail_router`/`user_gate_router`/`pre_action_hook_router` | `test_graph` | add a runtime branch that decides routing outside the four routers |
| I3 | **Triple-gated external fallback** — a call to Grok or Claude needs `mode=="hybrid"` AND `<provider>.enabled` AND `user_confirmed_online`, all three, for whichever provider is selected (`online_provider`) | `gate.py` construction + `graph.py` `user_gate_router` | `test_graph`, `test_gate` | route to `grok_fallback`/`claude_fallback` without all three conditions for that provider |
| I4 | **Audit convergence** — all eleven upstream paths reach `audit_logger` before END | `graph.py` edges | `test_graph` | add a node with a path to END that skips `audit_logger` |
| I5 | **Soul governance** — soul mutation requires a human `reason` string; writes are atomic | `utils/personality.py` `apply_evolution` | `test_personality` | write `soul.md` without a non-empty `reason`, or bypass `PersonalityManager` |
| I6 | **Module isolation** — `gate.py`/`gate_ops.py`/`gate_auth.py`/`gate_memory.py`/`graph.py`/`mcp_hybrid_server.py` never import `agentic`/`sync`/`guardrails`/`telegram`/`opentweet`, and those never import the core six | import graph | invariant-guard I6; `test_agentic_isolation` (AST, both directions) | `import agentic` (etc.) anywhere in the core six to "reuse" something |

Supporting guards (also checked by `invariant-guard`): telemetry-kill ordering
across 14 files — gate.py's `_TELEMETRY_KILL` anchor precedes its heavy
imports; every out-of-band package `__init__.py` (agentic, guardrails,
telegram, opentweet, sync) applies the kill before ANY other import; and the
eight module-level appliers (MCP server, metrics, vector_store, indexer,
clear_cache, guardrails/integration, gen_cert, authn_cli) apply it before
any third-party import — so no entry point
inherits an ambient telemetry env;
unset `CYCLAW_API_KEY` fails auth **closed** (401);
the sanitizer contract phrases stay caught; BM25 stays JSON (pickle = RCE); MCP
declares `sampling: None`.

**Before touching `gate.py`, `soul.md` handling, or the scanner, read
`INVARIANTS.md`** (repo root). It records which of these guarantees are enforced by
code vs. by convention (e.g. two of the three external-provider gates live in
`gate.py` construction, not the graph; the soul injection scan is write-path-only),
and names the test that pins each. `tests/test_due_diligence_invariants.py` is the
regression harness.


## 4. Mistakes You Will Make Here (and the rule that prevents each)

These are real traps in *this* codebase, verified against the code. Each pairs a
mistake a capable-but-unfamiliar agent makes with the rule that prevents it.

### Environment & install
- **Trap:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails or pulls a CUDA torch.
  **Rule:** install `torch==2.13.0+cpu` from the PyTorch CPU index **first**,
  then `pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt -c constraints.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML`.
- **Trap:** running that same torch line on macOS, or "fixing" the `+cpu` pin in
  the manifests when it 404s there. **Rule:** macOS needs **plain**
  `torch==2.13.0` — Apple Silicon publishes one arm64 wheel, so there is no
  CPU/CUDA build to disambiguate and no `+cpu` local version exists on the
  PyTorch index. Both manifests hardcode `+cpu` **by design** (dependency-
  confusion-proof reproducibility on Linux/Windows); install plain torch first,
  then feed pip a copy of `requirements.txt` with the `torch==`/
  `--extra-index-url` lines stripped and a copy of `constraints.txt` with only
  the `+cpu` suffix dropped from the torch pin. Do **not** strip the torch
  line from the constraints copy: `--ignore-installed` is a bare flag (the
  `PyYAML` after it is just one more requirement), so pip reinstalls every
  package including torch, and with no constraint the plain `2.13.0` you just
  installed is replaced by PyPI's newest torch (reproduced 2026-09-06: 2.14.0).
  `ci.yml`'s `macos-latest` leg and `macos/install-cyclaw.sh`'s `Darwin` branch
  both do this — see §8.
- **Trap:** moving the torch pin and touching only `requirements.txt`/
  `constraints.txt`. **Rule:** conda is a fourth install surface —
  `environment.yml` pins `pytorch=2.13.0=cpu*` (conda-forge names the package
  `pytorch`, not `torch`, and has no `+cpu` local tag), CI-gated by
  `python-package-conda.yml` and cross-checked by dep-guard D9. Bump
  `environment.yml` in the same commit as any torch pin move or the two
  surfaces silently diverge.
- **Trap:** running `cyclaw-server`/`cyclaw-index`/`cyclaw-metrics` after only
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`. **Rule:** those are `[project.scripts]`
  console scripts; pip writes the shims only when the **project itself** is
  installed (`pip install -e .`). `requirements.txt` is a third-party pin list
  with no self-install line, so the short names are `command not found` after
  it. The `python -m …` forms always work and are what both shipped launchers use.
- **Trap:** running `pytest` in a fresh container — no deps are installed.
  **Rule:** a freshly-cloned container has NO Python deps. Install first
  (`/CyClaw-Sandbox` — Quick Mode for a fast check, or the full audit for a
  Python 3.12 runtime gate) before any test/run step.
- **Trap:** assuming a fresh coding-agent sandbox's `python3`/`pip3` already
  target 3.12, or reflexively `apt install`ing a 3.12 you don't need. **Rule:**
  verified on the default Claude Code cloud sandbox image
  (`sandbox-ccr-default`, Ubuntu 24.04): Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 are **all
  already present** at `/usr/bin/python3.NN`, but `update-alternatives --list
  python3` registers only 3.11 — so bare `python3`/`pip3`/`pytest` silently run
  under 3.11 against a project whose `pyproject.toml` requires `>=3.12,<3.13`.
  (An earlier revision of this trap said CyClaw's deps were pre-installed into
  3.11's `dist-packages`; on 2026-09-06 no interpreter on the image had torch,
  chromadb, langgraph or pytest, so treat the venv below as mandatory. The
  `cyclaw-gotchas` skill's `driver.sh venv` does it, including the fallback
  for when the egress proxy denies `download.pytorch.org`.)
  This is invisible until a version-gated stdlib call fails: `test_agentic_*`
  (`agentic/deepagent_github/repo_workspace.py`'s `shutil.rmtree(onexc=...)`,
  a 3.12+ parameter) fails 142 tests with no other symptom, and it is easy to
  mistake for a red `main`. **Do not `apt install`/build a new Python** — it
  is already on disk. Point at it explicitly instead:
  `python3.12 -m venv /root/.venv-cyclaw-312 && /root/.venv-cyclaw-312/bin/pip
  install torch==2.13.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
  && /root/.venv-cyclaw-312/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r
  requirements-test.txt -c constraints.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML` (outside the repo tree so it
  never needs a `.gitignore` entry), then always invoke tests via
  `/root/.venv-cyclaw-312/bin/python -m pytest ...`. This venv does **not**
  survive session end — the container is reclaimed and rebuilt from the same
  generic image, not from anything in this repo — so treat it as a
  per-session setup step, not a one-time fix. Do not change the container's
  system-wide `python3` default (`update-alternatives`): the session
  runtime's own hook scripts (`~/.claude/*.py`) shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and resolve
  through it.
- **Trap:** assuming the server refuses to boot without `GROK_API_KEY`.
  **Rule:** `security.require_env` is **decorative** — no code reads it. The
  server boots fine; Grok just reports unavailable. Tests only need
  `GROK_API_KEY=dummy` (any non-empty value).
- **Trap:** treating `status: degraded` in `/health` or `TELEMETRY KILL` on
  startup as errors. **Rule:** both are normal (no Ollama; intentional env
  blocking).

### Boot semantics
- **Trap:** adding a hard failure when `data/personality/soul.md` is missing.
  **Rule:** it **self-heals** — `PersonalityManager._load_soul` writes a default
  and records a version. Do not add a boot crash. (There is no `soul_hash`
  constant; the baseline is the newest `soul_versions` DB row.)
- **Trap:** expecting the server to build the index on first run.
  **Rule:** a missing index is **fail-soft** — `/query` returns 503
  `INDEX_NOT_FOUND`. Build it explicitly: `python -m retrieval.indexer`.
- **Trap:** assuming no `CYCLAW_API_KEY` means soul endpoints are open.
  **Rule:** unset key = **fail closed (401)**, not open. Uses
  `hmac.compare_digest`.
- **Trap:** reordering imports in `gate.py` "to tidy them."
  **Rule:** the `_TELEMETRY_KILL` env block MUST stay above the heavy imports
  (`graph`, `retrieval`, `langchain`, `chromadb`). Setting the env after they
  load lets telemetry escape. `test_telemetry_kill` locks this. The same rule
  applies to `mcp_hybrid_server.py`'s `apply_telemetry_kill()` call — the
  `# noqa: E402` on the imports below it is load-bearing, not clutter.
- **Trap:** "simplifying" `gate.py` to `apply_telemetry_kill()` without keeping
  the `_TELEMETRY_KILL = ...` assignment. **Rule:** `invariant-guard`'s G1 check
  finds that name by **AST** and compares its line number to the first heavy
  import; drop the binding and G1 reports `kill at None` and fails.
- **Trap:** assuming `Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False)` covers ChromaDB
  telemetry. **Rule:** it governs only the PostHog product-telemetry path. OTel
  is separate and driven by `CHROMA_OTEL_GRANULARITY` — chromadb's `otel_init()`
  early-returns only when that is `"none"`, otherwise it builds a
  TracerProvider + BatchSpanProcessor + OTLPSpanExporter. Both defenses are in
  `utils/telemetry_kill.py`; neither is redundant.
- **Trap:** "completing" `utils/telemetry_kill.py`'s `TELEMETRY_KILL` dict by
  adding `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`/`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` — they're documented in
  `docs/security-philosophy/cyclaw_telemetry_kill.env` and look like an
  omission. **Rule:** they are excluded on purpose. `huggingface_hub` latches
  `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` at its own import time, so forcing it unconditionally would
  turn `retrieval/embeddings.py`'s documented cache-miss bootstrap fetch into a
  guaranteed failure on any machine that has never run CyClaw before.
  `_load_model` sets both, but only after `_model_offline_eligible` confirms
  the model is already on disk via `huggingface_hub.try_to_load_from_cache`
  (network-free) — never unconditionally, and never by clearing an operator's
  own stricter choice if they sourced the `.env` file by hand. The env vars
  alone do NOT enforce this in-process (the probe's own `huggingface_hub`
  import latches the offline constant before the vars are set) — the actual
  gate is `local_files_only=eligible` passed to `SentenceTransformer(...)`.
- **Trap:** treating ONNX Runtime's `ORT_TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT` env var as a real
  kill switch — or, since issue #1135, assuming ORT telemetry is still
  Windows-only. **Rule:** `ORT_TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT` isn't read by onnxruntime at
  all (zero references in the installed package; kept only as an inert legacy
  marker for reference-`.env` parity — tests and the otel-hardening checker
  must never count it as protection). The platform story changed at v1.29.0
  (2025-08-12): non-Windows official builds carry 1DS telemetry too, and the
  documented pre-init env control is `ORT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` — now in
  `TELEMETRY_KILL`. The runtime API `onnxruntime.disable_telemetry_events()`
  IS wired since #1135 (`utils/onnx_telemetry.py`, called at both load
  seams), but it is the post-import second layer: it cannot undo an
  init-time event, which is why the env var must come first. On Windows
  (ETW/TraceLogging, collected only by an external trace session) absolute
  suppression needs a `--no_telemetry` private build — never claim it.

### Retrieval & config
- **Trap:** "fixing" `min_score: 0.028` upward toward a cosine-like 0.5, or
  above the hybrid ceiling ~0.033.
  **Rule:** it is on the **RRF scale**. Dual rank-0 with `rrf_k=60` is
  `2/61 ≈ 0.0328`. Raising `min_score` above that routes every hybrid query
  to the user gate. Topical strictness is `min_semantic_score` (cosine), not
  a higher RRF threshold.
- **Trap:** unifying the test mock's `min_score` (0.75) with production (0.028).
  **Rule:** they are intentionally different and both load-bearing. The mock
  high/low scores straddle 0.75; production RRF scores straddle 0.028.
- **Trap:** setting a config key to change the embedding cache size.
  **Rule:** the size is fixed at import via `lru_cache`; only the env var
  `CYCLAW_EMBED_CACHE_SIZE` changes it.
- **Trap:** editing `config.yaml` in a running process and expecting new
  patterns. **Rule:** the sanitizer `lru_cache`s by config path. Re-run the
  process. (`enabled: true` + zero patterns silently degrades to length-only.)

### Testing
- **Trap:** changing conftest `test_config` to a shallow `.copy()`.
  **Rule:** it MUST stay a deepcopy — a shallow copy leaks mutations across
  tests (order-dependent flakes). `test_conftest_fixtures` guards it.
- **Trap:** `import gate` at a test module's top level.
  **Rule:** importing gate triggers full app init (FastAPI + ChromaDB +
  retriever). Use a subprocess (`test_telemetry_kill`) or module-level patching
  (`test_gate`).
- **Trap:** running `pytest` locally, seeing green, assuming coverage passed.
  **Rule:** bare `pytest` runs **no** coverage (`addopts` has no `--cov`). The
  80% gate is `fail_under` in `pyproject.toml`, applied only with the CI-style
  explicit `--cov=` flags. New **source modules** need a `--cov=` flag in
  `ci.yml` AND an entry in `[tool.coverage.run] source`; new **test files**
  auto-discover.
- **Trap:** renaming `ci_rag_smoke.py` to `test_ci_rag_smoke.py`.
  **Rule:** it is deliberately NOT `test_*`-named so pytest ignores it; it runs
  as a separate CI step. Renaming double-runs it and drags ChromaDB into the
  unit lane.
- **Trap:** a fresh `MockGrokClient` to simulate "no API key."
  **Rule:** it defaults `available=True`. Pass `available=False` for that path.
- **Trap:** trimming `banned_patterns` and assuming a count test catches it.
  **Rule:** no test asserts `== 40`. But `TestShippedConfigContract` runs
  specific **phrases** against the real config — deleting a documented phrase
  fails tests. Adding patterns is safe; removing coverage is not.
- **Trap:** adding a state-changing POST route without touching the console
  contract. **Rule:** `test_terminal_contract` extracts routes from
  `terminal.html`; new POST endpoints must be added to its `_POST_PATHS`.
- **Trap:** assuming `mypy --strict --python-version 3.12 .` runs clean, or is
  a CI gate. **Rule:** it is neither. Only `lint.yml` runs `ruff`: its F/B/S
  logic, likely-bug, and security classes block merges, while its broader Ruff
  set and WPS remain advisory. `ci.yml` does not run ruff at all, and mypy is
  not wired into any CI workflow. The bare repo-root invocation errors
  out immediately on `utils/errors.py` ("Source file found twice under
  different module names") because `utils/` has no `__init__.py`; add
  `--explicit-package-bases` to get past discovery, and even then the tree
  carries pre-existing untyped legacy code and missing third-party stubs (found
  during Phase 2 verification, 2026-07-09). Treat it as a best-effort check
  scoped to the lines you actually wrote, not a pass/fail gate on the whole
  repo or even a whole file you only partly touched.

### Code conventions
- **Trap:** `raise Exception(...)` or a bare `except:`.
  **Rule:** raise a typed error from `utils/errors.py` (rooted at `RAGError`
  with `.code`/`.message`/`.details`). Out-of-band subsystems use their own
  subtrees. (`RcloneTimeoutError` deliberately bypasses its parent `__init__` to
  keep its sub-code — do not "simplify" it.)
- **Trap:** changing an error `code` string or the `"{code}: {message}"` stamp
  format. **Rule:** these are asserted verbatim in `test_graph`. Also: success
  paths must NOT emit an `error` key (it would clobber an upstream error).
- **Trap:** returning generic `sys.exit(1)` from a CLI.
  **Rule:** exit codes are an API. Agentic: `0` ok · `2` failed · `3` env/config
  · `4` write refused. Sync uses `10` = corpus-changed → reindex. `clear_cache`:
  `0`/`2`/`3`. Match them.
- **Trap:** "optimizing" the BM25 store to pickle.
  **Rule:** BM25 stays JSON (`index/bm25.json`). Pickle is an RCE vector;
  `test_security` guards it.
- **Trap:** logging raw query text "for debugging."
  **Rule:** the audit log stores SHA-256 hashes only; raw text is never
  persisted. `test_gate` enforces it.
- **Trap:** treating MCP `hybrid_search` as unsanitized.
  **Rule:** E3 (`#974`) runs `check_input` before retrieval (same
  `banned_patterns` / `max_input_chars` as HTTP `/query`) and audits
  `prompt_injection_blocked`. `sampling: None` is unchanged.
- **Trap:** re-reading `config.yaml` inside a module, or using cwd-relative
  paths. **Rule:** config is loaded once and passed down as a `cfg` dict. Paths
  anchor to `_BASE_DIR`/`_REPO_ROOT`, never cwd (Windows double-click breaks
  cwd assumptions).

### Dependencies
- **Trap:** bumping `pydantic-core` alone, or adding `[standard]` to the uvicorn
  constraint. **Rule:** `pydantic` and `pydantic-core` are lock-step
  (2.13.4 ↔ 2.46.4); the `uvicorn` constraint carries no extras (pip ≥26.1.2
  rejects extras in a constraints file).
- **Trap:** letting numpy float to 2.x. **Rule:** numpy is pinned `<2`
  (dependabot ignores `numpy>=2.0.0`) — numpy 2 removes `np.float_` and breaks
  chromadb/onnxruntime.
- **Trap:** "fixing" the chromadb CVE. **Rule:** it is risk-accepted,
  embedded-`PersistentClient`-only per the threat model. Do not switch to the
  HTTP client or file a fix PR.

### Git & PR
- **Trap:** pushing to `main` via the GitHub MCP while a feature branch + open PR
  exist. **Rule:** never — it creates add/add rebase conflicts. Branch → draft
  PR → human merges.
- **Trap:** force-pushing after a rebase without asking.
  **Rule:** a force-push (`--force-with-lease`) needs explicit user sign-off
  first (the session runtime blocks it otherwise).
- **Trap:** two branches editing the same shared file (`ci.yml`, `config.yaml`,
  manifests, `CLAUDE.md`) cut from the same base. **Rule:** trial-merge the pair
  locally before opening PRs; a careless conflict resolution drops one side.
- **Trap:** diagnosing a child PR's red CI as the PR's fault.
  **Rule:** a red `main` poisons every branch cut from it. Check `main`'s own
  state first.
- **Trap:** opening a draft PR and going dark — never watching its CI, so it
  sits silently red until the human trips over it (the bottleneck lands on the
  operator). **Rule:** subscribe to the PR's activity events at creation when
  the session runtime offers it (e.g. `subscribe_pr_activity`) and drive it to
  green until merged or closed; a red check on a PR you opened is your work,
  not the reviewer's discovery. Runtimes without event delivery (e.g. Kimi via
  `gh`) check CI once after push, then hand the watch to the operator
  *explicitly* — never silently.
- **Trap:** the opposite over-correction — a recurring poll (an hourly
  "re-check the PR" timer, re-armed forever) beside a live event subscription.
  **Rule:** events are the signal: near-zero cost when quiet, and the
  operator's own resync at the next session start reconciles anything a
  dropped event hid. No polling loop duplicates a subscription. At most ONE
  long-fuse (4–6h), non-re-arming safety sweep across all open PRs per
  session — and in a multi-agent fleet, exactly one agent owns that sweep
  while every agent dedups against open PRs (`list_pull_requests`) before
  scanning or implementing, or two models will write the same fix twice.

---

## 5. Conventions

### Code
- **Python 3.12** (`requires-python >=3.12`). Fully type-annotated; PEP 604
  unions (`str | None`), builtin generics, `TypedDict`/`Protocol`/`Literal` over
  `Any`. `from __future__ import annotations` in new modules.
- **Lint:** `lint.yml` blocks on `ruff check --select F,B,S .` (Pyflakes
  logic errors, likely-bug patterns, and Bandit security checks). Its broader
  `ruff check --select E,F,I,B,C4,UP,S .` pass remains advisory, as does WPS;
  line length is 120, `E501` is ignored, and `.claude` is excluded. Keep the
  full Ruff set clean locally even though only F/B/S block merge. **Types:**
  `mypy --strict --python-version 3.12 --explicit-package-bases` as a
  best-effort discipline on the lines you write — not CI-enforced, and the
  repo does not pass it clean end-to-end today (see the §4 Testing trap).
- **No `print`** in library code — use `logging.getLogger("cyclaw.<module>")`
  with lazy `%s` formatting. Audit is a separate JSONL stream.
- **No `shell=True`** with user input; always `subprocess.run([...], list-form)`.
- **No secrets in code** — env vars only. **No TODO/FIXME comments** — this repo
  has none; encode intent in explanatory comments instead (match the density and
  "why, with PR reference" style of the surrounding code).
- Data-modifying scripts default to a safe dry-run (`--apply` to act).

### Commits, branches, PRs
- **Conventional commits:** `feat:`/`fix:`/`perf:`/`chore:`/`test:`/`docs:`/`ci:`
  (`feat(scope):` when scoped).
- **Branches:** short-lived `agent/<topic>` (or env-overridden prefix; e.g. `claude/`/`codex/` when that agent is driving), deleted after
  merge. Develop on the assigned feature branch; never on `main`.
- **PRs are draft.** One reviewable concern each. Body = **What / Why / Risk to
  monitor**. A human decides when to merge.
- **Watch what you open — by events, not polls.** Every agent-opened PR gets an
  activity subscription at creation and is driven to green until merged or
  closed; no fire-and-forget drafts, and no recurring polling loop beside a
  live subscription (see the §4 Git & PR traps for the full rule and the
  multi-agent variant).

### Docs
- Dated audit/report docs go in `docs/audits/`. Live memory lives ONLY in
  `docs/memories/` (`.claude/memory/` is legacy — do not add there).
- Every `##` section must be self-contained (no pronoun references to earlier
  sections) — the corpus is chunked and searched section-by-section.
- Don't duplicate another doc's authority; link to it. `config.yaml` owns the
  numbers — cite, don't copy-and-drift.

### Kimi Code agents
- This operating manual applies verbatim to Kimi Code sessions — same
  invariants, same test gate, same draft-PR flow. Kimi reads `CLAUDE.md` /
  `AGENTS.md` like any other agent.
- **Branches:** use the `kimi/<topic>` prefix (e.g.
  `kimi/cyclaw-optimize-<topic>`); everything in §5 "Commits, branches, PRs"
  otherwise holds.
- **`gh` trap (Windows operator machine):** bare `gh` on PATH is a py3dot12
  shim, NOT GitHub CLI. Always call the real one by full path:
  `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"` (authenticated as `cgfixit`).
  The §4 Git-MCP traps apply to `gh pr`/`git push` identically.
- **No GitHub MCP / stop-hook assumptions:** Kimi has neither the GitHub MCP
  tools nor the session stop-hook this repo's Claude skills reference — use
  `gh` for PR list/create and the user's own configured git identity.
- **Optimize skill:** the Kimi port of `.claude/skills/CyClaw-Optimize/` lives
  machine-side at `~/.agents/skills/cyclaw-optimize/` (same workflow:
  bootstrap → 4-minute read-only scan subagent → PR dedup via `gh` → ~5
  focused draft PRs). The in-repo Claude skill remains canonical; keep the
  two in step when the workflow changes.
- **PR body = the template, not an ad hoc shape:** before opening a PR, read
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and populate its sections. (Root-caused
  2026-07-28: Kimi's PR bodies were observed using a fixed `What`/`Why`/
  `Verification`/`Risk to monitor` shape identical to `.codex/`'s pre-fix
  instructions — Kimi's machine-side prompt likely mirrors that same spec.
  If so, update `~/.agents/` to point at the template the same way
  `.codex/Codex_instructions.md` now does, per the "keep the two in
  step" rule above.)

- [ ] uses `tests/conftest.py` fixtures; starts no live service
- [ ] asserts behavior/contract, not incidental implementation detail
- [ ] deterministic — no real `sleep` racing a timeout, no network, no clock
- [ ] discovered by pytest without editing `ci.yml`

**Pull request**
- [ ] draft; conventional-commit title; body has What / Why / Risk to monitor
- [ ] one concern; diff reviewable in one sitting
- [ ] if it shares a file with another open PR, a local trial-merge was verified
- [ ] CI green, or each failure explained against `main`'s own state

**Documentation**
- [ ] every number sourced from `config.yaml`/`pyproject.toml` (none invented)
- [ ] `##` sections self-contained; dated if it is a report
- [ ] `python3 .claude/skills/doc-sync/doc_sync.py` shows no new drift it caused

**Skill**
- [ ] YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`); numbered steps with exact commands
- [ ] a Guardrails section restating the relevant invariants
- [ ] a Gotchas section
- [ ] a self-contained `verify.sh` if it ships an executable (CI auto-runs it,

## 7. When Uncertain — Escalation Rules

Classify every action before doing it.

| Tier | Concrete triggers | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| **Low** | Local, reversible, narrow: format, add a test, fix a doc typo, read code, run a documented command | Proceed. Standard checks. |
| **Medium** | Shared code path, recoverable: edit a module's logic, add a dependency, change a fixture, refactor within one subsystem | Proceed; expand tests; state the rollback path in the PR body |
| **High** | Irreversible or broad: destructive command, force-push, `soul.md` mutation, editing a graph edge / auth / sanitizer pattern, weakening any test, a new runtime dependency, anything touching a security invariant | **Stop and ask first** |

When unsure which tier, choose the higher one.

**Always ask first (High):** deleting/overwriting files you didn't create;
force-push; `git push` to `main`; mutating `soul.md`; changing graph edges,
`banned_patterns`, or auth; loosening a test or the coverage gate; adding a
runtime dependency; wiring a new hook in `settings.json`.

**Never ask (just do it):** running the documented test/lint/run commands;
reading anything; adding tests; fixing doc typos; `ruff format`; running any of
the `.claude/skills/*/check_*.py` or `verify.sh` checkers.

**Mid-task ambiguity with two reasonable readings:** state your assumption,
proceed on the **smallest reversible** interpretation, and flag it in the PR
body — do not stall. Use `AskUser` only when the readings diverge on something
irreversible or a matter of user taste.

**Blocked:** record it in `docs/work/SESSION_NOTES.md`
and escalate — `#cyclaw-dev` for undefined behavior, a private GitHub security
issue for security concerns, `/CyClaw-Sandbox` for suspected config drift
(its Python-3.12 runtime gate phase catches this).

Do NOT: re-ask a question already answered; ask the user to reveal a secret;
change code behavior to make a stale doc "true" (fix the doc, or flag the
behavior gap).

## 8. Commands That Work

Skills reference this section; keep it as the single canonical copy.

```bash
# Install — Linux/Windows (order matters — torch CPU FIRST)
pip install torch==2.13.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt -c constraints.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML

# Install — macOS (Apple Silicon): PLAIN torch, no +cpu suffix, no index override.
# The +cpu local-version wheel does not exist for macOS and both manifests
# hardcode that pin, so the generic block above fails twice on a Mac. Strip the
# torch/index lines from the requirements copy but only drop the +cpu suffix in
# the constraints copy: --ignore-installed is a bare flag (PyYAML is just one
# more requirement), so pip reinstalls torch too and an unconstrained copy
# floats it to PyPI's newest — same thing ci.yml's macos-latest leg runs.
pip install "torch==2.13.0"
grep -v -e '^torch==' -e '^--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org' \
    requirements.txt > /tmp/requirements-macos.txt
sed 's/^\(torch==[0-9][0-9.]*\)+cpu$/\1/' constraints.txt > /tmp/constraints-macos.txt
pip install -r /tmp/requirements-macos.txt -r requirements-test.txt -c /tmp/constraints-macos.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML

# Install — conda (fourth surface; CI-gated by python-package-conda.yml).
# conda-forge names the torch package `pytorch` (pinned 2.13.0=cpu*) — see the §4 trap.
conda env create -f environment.yml

# The cyclaw-* console scripts below need the project itself installed —
# requirements.txt is a third-party pin list with no self-install line, so
# without this they are `command not found`. The `python -m …` forms always work.
pip install -e . -c constraints.txt

# Build the retrieval index (required before /query returns hits)
python -m retrieval.indexer            # or: cyclaw-index (needs pip install -e .)

# Tests (GROK_API_KEY must be any non-empty value)
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/test_graph.py -q --tb=short   # single file
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/test_agentic_*.py -q          # agentic only
GROK_API_KEY=dummy python tests/ci_rag_smoke.py               # real-index RAG smoke

# Lint / types (Ruff F/B/S is CI-enforced; broader Ruff and WPS are advisory;
# mypy is a best-effort local check only — see the §4 Testing trap for why
# the bare "mypy ... ." invocation errors out)
ruff check --select E,F,I,B,C4,UP,S .
mypy --strict --python-version 3.12 --explicit-package-bases "<touched files>"

# Run the server + probe health
python gate.py            # or: cyclaw-server   (binds 127.0.0.1:8787)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health

# Run the retrieval-only MCP server (stdio; no LLM path)
python mcp_hybrid_server.py                    # or: cyclaw-mcp

# Metrics / cache
python -m metrics                              # or: cyclaw-metrics
python -m retrieval.clear_cache                # dry-run; add --apply to delete

# Invariant / config / deps / doc / retrieval / sanitizer health (skills)
python3 .claude/skills/invariant-guard/check_invariants.py
python3 .claude/skills/config-guard/check_config.py     # add --strict to lock shipped defaults
python3 .claude/skills/dep-guard/check_deps.py          # pure stdlib; runs pre-install
python3 .claude/skills/verify-deps/extract_pins.py      # requirements.txt cross-check; add --json
python3 .claude/skills/verify-deps/check_env_drift.py   # non-manifest drift E1-E6 incl. the Docker surface; add --strict
python3 .claude/skills/doc-sync/doc_sync.py
python3 .claude/skills/index-doctor/doctor.py --rebuild
python3 .claude/skills/injection-redteam/redteam.py
```

CI target is Python 3.12 on a three-OS matrix (ubuntu + windows + macos); all
three `test` legs are release gates (a failing Windows result is not masked).
Inside `ci.yml` the only job carrying `continue-on-error` is `verify-skills`;
every other job (including the three `test` legs, `invariant-guard`, and
packaging) fails the workflow. Advisory lanes elsewhere are
`numbat-rules.yml`, `lint.yml`'s broader-Ruff and WPS steps (its F/B/S gate
blocks), and best-effort steps in the
nemo-guardrails/pr-review/conda/trivy workflows. Coverage sources:
`gate`, `gate_ops`, `gate_auth`, `gate_memory`, `graph`, `mcp_hybrid_server`, `metrics`, `llm`, `retrieval`,
`utils`, `sync`, `agentic`, `guardrails`, `telegram`, `opentweet`, `memory`, `schemas`. `tests/conftest.py` mocks
all external deps — no live services required. The full test-file list is
discoverable in `tests/` (206 `test_*.py` files including the two under
`tests/nemo_runtime/`, auto-collected by pytest).

## 9. Skills

Skills live at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. When a skill is not present in
the local sandbox, **check GitHub main before declaring it absent** (via
`mcp__github__get_file_contents` on `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).

### CyClaw-specific security & health skills (built on the invariants)

| Skill | Type | Purpose | Runs pre-install? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/invariant-guard` | check | Static-assert the six invariants + guards against a diff | Yes (stdlib) |
| `/config-guard` | check | Static-validate config.yaml's relational/value/threat-model contract (graph_timeout>llm_timeout, chunk_overlap<chunk_size, RRF-scale min_score, loopback host, safe posture, `api_key_optional` vs. the bind address) | Needs PyYAML |
| `/dep-guard` | check | Static-validate dependency-pin invariants across pyproject + constraints + environment.yml (pydantic lock-step, numpy<2, torch +cpu, uvicorn no-extras, cross-file agreement) | Yes (stdlib) |
| `/verify-deps` | check | Extends dep-guard: adds the requirements.txt cross-check dep-guard skips, the non-manifest drift checks E1–E6 (workflow tool pins, Python version, undeclared imports, install-surface scope, the Dockerfile install contract incl. its torch pin vs constraints.txt, and docker-compose.yml/.dockerignore/publish-ghcr.yml coherence with the Dockerfile), a dry-run of each install surface's actual command, and a PyPI currency + CVE sweep. Reports only — never auto-bumps a runtime pin | extract_pins.py + check_env_drift.py yes (stdlib); currency sweep needs network |
| `/injection-redteam` | loop | Adversarial probe corpus vs the sanitizer; close bypasses | Needs venv |
| `/index-doctor` | check | Rebuild + validate ChromaDB/BM25/RRF; probe retrieval health | Needs venv |
| `/doc-sync` | check | Detect code↔docs drift; reconcile the docs | Needs PyYAML |
| `/otel-hardening` | check + task | Validate the full telemetry-kill contract: an independent name→value oracle over both canonical maps + the scrub set, staleness (`--as-of`), pin drift, reference-`.env` format/values, Docker/launcher/generator delivery, programmatic-bypass sweep, ONNX seams, and a category-1–5 egress classification of every dependency/executable/connector/launcher (strict mode fails on an unclassified one); then the live vendor-doc sweep. 22-scenario mutation self-test in `verify.sh` | Yes (stdlib) for the static half; live sweep needs network |

### Operational & workflow skills

| Skill | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/CyClaw-Optimize` | task | Scan main for optimizations; open focused draft PRs |
| `/CyClaw-Sandbox` | task | Clone main, mock Ollama, full audit incl. Python 3.12 runtime gate, dated report + PR. `/run` = its Quick Mode (no clone/report/PR) |
| `/architecture-refactor` `/speed-refactor` `/tests-refactor` `/logging-refactor` | loop | Iterative refactor loops |
| `/wrap-up` | task | End-of-session checklist (ship / remember / improve / publish) |
| `/create-session-notes` | task | Maintain `SESSION_NOTES.md` |
| `/ponytail` | mode | Lazy-senior-dev mode: YAGNI, stdlib-first, minimal abstraction |
| `/add-comment` | task | Comment-only pass adding ELI5-toned WHY comments to under-documented code |
| `/karpathy-guidelines` | mode | Anti-overcomplication guardrails: surgical diffs, surfaced assumptions, verifiable success criteria |
| `/cyclaw-advisor` | mode | "Legal" persona for privacy/DPA/DSR/breach-analysis review of CyClaw changes |
| `/cyclaw-gotchas` | reference + driver | Session-tested traps for Claude Code sandboxes (proxy-denied torch/Hugging Face hosts, the 3.12 venv, the silent pytest summary, PR/check-in/review-bot process) plus `driver.sh` (`inventory`/`venv`/`serve`/`probe`/`stop`/`test`/`checks`). Load before installing deps, running tests, launching `gate.py`, or driving a PR |

### Standalone commands (no skill folder)

`/audit`, `/check-soul`, `/conversation-summary`, `/run`, and `/status` are
short inline procedures wired only as `.claude/commands/*.md`, with no
`.claude/skills/` directory behind them — deliberate, and tracked as such in
`.claude/README.md`. They are reachable as slash commands like any skill.

### Agent skills

`/verification-specialist`, `/code-explorer`,
`/general-purpose`, `/documentation-guide`, `/next-action-suggestion`,
`/session-title`, `/tool-summary`, and the memory
skills (`/memory-extraction`, `/memory-consolidation`, `/memory-orchestrator`)
are each a `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` entry. `/conversation-summary` plays the
same session-continuation role but is wired as `.claude/commands/conversation-summary.md`
(a slash command), not a SKILL.md-backed skill — listed here for discoverability, not
because it is a skill directory.
`/python-coding-agent` auto-loads via the SessionStart hook; its Planning Mode
covers pre-implementation design (formerly a separate `solution-architect`
skill, folded in since both need the same CyClaw-specific grounding).

### Cross-repo behavioral skill

`/fable-protocol` — reasoning-discipline, epistemic-calibration, AND
knowledge-handoff layer (mark speculation, verify stale knowledge, security
lens on every generated artifact, anti-sycophancy, Sonnet 5 vs Opus 5 routing,
plus the owner's communication contract, project portfolio, CyClaw facts to
know cold, settled decisions, and where a smaller model must compensate).
Scoped to the user, not to CyClaw: it is registered both at
`.claude/skills/fable-protocol/SKILL.md` in this repo and at the user-level
`~/.claude/skills/fable-protocol/SKILL.md`, so it activates in any repository,
not only here. Its later sections do document CyClaw architecture and settled
decisions as a knowledge base, but carry no independent authority — `CLAUDE.md`
and `config.yaml` remain the source of truth, and neither this skill's
discipline layer nor its knowledge layer overrides the six invariants in §3.
Read at session start in any of the owner's repos; in this repo the
`fable-protocol-loader.sh` SessionStart hook does that automatically for every
non-Fable model (§10). See the skill file for the
full protocol (consolidated 2026-09-06 from a separate `fable-5.1-cc`
companion skill, which no longer exists as its own file — its content is now
this skill's §8 onward).

---

## 10. Session Protocol

**Start.** Three SessionStart hooks run: one injects the Python-coding-agent
persona; `session-start-sync-check.sh` (wired since 2026-09-04) pins the git
identity and reports local↔remote divergence without ever mutating — it never
resets, rebases, pushes or deletes, and always exits 0. If it did not run, set the
identity yourself before any commit:

```bash
git config user.email cyclaw-agent@users.noreply.github.com
git config user.name "CyClaw Agent"
```

The third, `fable-protocol-loader.sh` (wired 2026-09-06), injects
`/fable-protocol` as session context unless the session model is Fable-tier
(`fable`/`mythos` in the model id). It reads the model from the SessionStart
hook's stdin JSON, the only hook event that carries one; a mid-session `/model`
switch fires no hook, so after switching to Sonnet or Opus mid-session run
`/fable-protocol` by hand. Absent or unrecognised model strings inject.

Single source of truth: `utils/agent_identity.py`. Committer defaults are
**driver-agnostic** (not Claude/Anthropic) because the agentic loop is often a
local model or another coding agent — attribution should not pretend otherwise.
Both write surfaces read the same module: repo_workspace commits and writer
PR heads.

**Branch namespaces** follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — validation
accepts every listed vendor (and `agent/`):

| Driver | Branch form |
|--------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `claude/{feature}` |
| Codex | `codex/{feature}` |
| Grok Build | `grok/{feature}` |
| Kimi / Kimi Code | `kimi/{feature}` |
| CyClaw direct / MCP | `CyClaw/{feature}-{date}` (also `cyclaw/`) |
| Unknown / generic | `agent/{feature}` |

Environment overrides (optional, per session):

- `CYCLAW_AGENT_COMMIT_NAME` (default `CyClaw Agent`)
- `CYCLAW_AGENT_COMMIT_EMAIL` (default `cyclaw-agent@users.noreply.github.com`)
- `CYCLAW_AGENT_BRANCH_PREFIX` (default `agent` — *preferred* prefix only;
  does **not** revoke the multi-vendor allowlist above)

Caveat: an external **session-runtime** stop hook (outside this repo) may still
enforce a different committer email if your host installs one — align that
hook with these defaults, or set the env vars to match what the hook allows.

A stop hook, if applied by the **session runtime** (not wired in repo
`settings.json`), may reject commits whose committer email does not match its
allowlist and blocks `--force-with-lease` without explicit authorization.

**During.** Track compact memory: Goal, Constraints, Decisions (with one-line
rationale), Open questions, Verification state. Prefer file-backed facts over
inference. Expire stale assumptions when new evidence appears.

**End.** Run `/wrap-up`. Durable project conventions → this file or
`.claude/rules/`. Session-scoped discoveries → `docs/memories/` (live) via the
memory skills. Reconcile this file against the current code state — run
`/doc-sync` — before you consider the session done.
