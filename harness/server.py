"""FastAPI control plane + console host for the CyClaw PowerShell harness.

Serves ``static/harness.html`` and a small JSON API on loopback
(``127.0.0.1:8790`` by default — gate.py owns :8787). This is a SEPARATE app
from the RAG gateway: gate.py/graph.py/mcp_hybrid_server.py never import this
package and vice versa (invariant I6). GitHub operations go through the
``utils.ops_runner`` subprocess shim into ``agentic.cli``, exactly like the
``/ops/agentic`` endpoint — the harness never imports agentic's write paths.

Threat-model posture matches CyClaw's: single-operator, loopback-only,
single-tenant. No remote bind, no shell execution, no writes outside the
harness home directory.
