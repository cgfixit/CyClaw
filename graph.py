"""CyClaw LangGraph controller: retrieval first, routing by edges, audit at exit.

High-score queries pass through the input rail to local_llm. Low-score queries
reach user_gate, then a provider-specific pre-action hook, the input rail and
offline_best_effort, or audit_logger. A blocked input rail or denied hook routes
to audit_logger without generation. Generated answers pass through guardrail_output
before audit_logger; the output check itself applies only to local_llm answers.

External calls require gate.py to construct clients under hybrid mode and literal
provider enablement. user_gate_router additionally checks request confirmation,
provider selection, and client availability; it does not recheck mode/enabled.
See INVARIANTS.md for the division between construction and graph enforcement.

Guard functions are injected through utils/guardrail_bridge.py so this module
never imports guardrails. PersonalityManager supplies the local and offline soul
preambles; external prompt assembly omits them. Interaction persistence runs before
audit_log so a caught database failure can be included in the audit event.

    All nodes are partial functions — dependencies injected at build time,
