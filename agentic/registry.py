"""Governed skills registry for the agentic layer.

A JSON-backed catalog of "skills" (name + description + body) that reuses the
SAME governance pattern as soul evolution (utils/personality.py):

  - ``propose_skill`` NEVER writes. It returns a diff plus *advisory* injection
    flags so a human can review the change.
  - ``apply_skill`` ENFORCES the injection gate at the write boundary, requires a
    non-empty human ``reason``, writes atomically (tmp + os.replace), and records
    a sha256-versioned history entry.

The injection scanner is the SAME union the soul scanner uses -- the curated
``policy.prompt_filter.banned_patterns`` from config.yaml unioned with the OWASP
baseline -- so a skill body can never smuggle in instructions that the query path
would reject. This is the soul-governance invariant applied to a new surface.

Never imported by gate.py / graph.py / mcp_hybrid_server.py.

Wired with governance_score in feature/CyClaw-Agent for agentic visibility.
