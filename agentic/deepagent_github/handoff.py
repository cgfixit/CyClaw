"""Sanitized context handoff for the agentic plane's cloud egress.

The point of this module is that a cloud model call is audited *as egress*, not
merely as a model call. Before any bytes leave the machine, the outbound prompt
is injection-checked, redacted, hashed, and recorded -- so the audit log can
answer "what left, when, to whom, and how much of it was redacted" without ever
storing the prompt itself.

Two limitations to state plainly to anyone this evidence is shown to:
(1) redaction is pattern-based. It removes recognizable secret and PII SHAPES and
    cannot certify that free text contains no confidential meaning. Restricting
    WHICH documents are eligible for cloud context is the stronger control.
(2) once bytes reach a provider, retention and processing are governed by that
    provider's agreement, not by CyClaw. That is why the per-run confirmation
    gate exists.
