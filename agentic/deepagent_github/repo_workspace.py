"""Real-repo workspace surface for the Deep Agents GitHub harness.

Closes the gap the audit found: containment-by-copy already existed
(``harness_optimizer``'s fixture runner), but nothing in the codebase could
clone a REAL repository. This module clones, jails, and reads -- and, as of the
git-write addition below, can also make local commits inside that same jailed
clone. As of P10 it can also PUSH one ``claude/`` branch to origin
(:meth:`RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch`) -- the single method here that reaches
the network, gated on the same ``allow_git_write_tools`` flag (default
``False``) as every other write, and passing no credential of its own. It still
opens no pull request and makes no GitHub API call; that is
``agentic/writer.py``'s gate. It is not wired into
``build_deepagent_github`` in this change: that wiring needs a
second tool-source parameter threaded through ``builder.py``/``tools.py``
(today's ``workspace_tools`` is hard-typed to a single ``ProposerWorkspaceTools``
instance), and there is no live caller yet to wire it FOR -- the planner/loop
driver that would consume a real-repo read-and-write surface doesn't exist
until a later phase. Shipping the capability now, fully tested and
independently usable, and deferring the wiring, mirrors how the injection
scanner and the deepagent-plan CLI probe were each shipped ahead of their
eventual consumers earlier in this same effort.

No optional dependency: unlike the rest of ``deepagent_github/``, this module
needs nothing beyond ``gh``/``git`` (already required for every other agentic
read, and for the local ``git clone`` machinery generally) and the stdlib. It
is fully testable without ``deepagents``/``langchain`` installed.

Containment for READS: :class:`agentic.fsconnect.pathsafe.ScopedRoots` -- the
strongest primitive in the repo (POSIX ``openat``/``O_NOFOLLOW``/held
``dir_fd``, zero TOCTOU window) -- jails every read to the exact directory the
clone populated. The clone itself runs entirely through ``agentic.gh_client``'s
existing chokepoint: same binary resolution, version floor, and
transient-retry policy every other read op gets, via the ``repo_clone`` op this
change adds there.

Containment for git WRITES: ``ScopedRoots`` is a read-only file-descriptor
primitive, not a subprocess sandbox, so it isn't the mechanism here. Each git
write method instead runs ``git`` as an argv-list subprocess with ``cwd``
pinned to the exact clone directory the ``repo_clone`` op populated, a scrubbed
environment allowlist, and a wall-clock timeout -- the same house pattern
``agentic/executor/runner.py`` and ``agentic/fsconnect/indexer.py::_run_reindex``
already established. Every write method is additionally gated on
``deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools`` (default ``False``), a config field
of its own -- see the field's docstring in ``agentic/config.py`` for why this
is deliberately NOT a reuse of ``allow_shell_execution``.

``write_file`` is not a git operation at all -- it is a plain, path-validated
filesystem write (create or overwrite) inside the clone, the step that
actually puts candidate content on disk before ``add``/``commit`` stage and
record it. It shares the same ``allow_git_write_tools`` gate and the same
path-safety validation ``add`` uses, extended to tolerate a target that does
not exist yet (a new file), by walking up to the nearest existing ancestor
the same way ``harness_optimizer/mcp/tools.py``'s write-target check does.

          30s on "local git plumbing only -- no network"; that reasoning does
          not survive a push, so this uses the clone-sized budget instead.

        * A re-validated branch name, and ``--`` before it, so the value can
          never be reparsed as an option or a refspec with extra parts.

        CREDENTIALS: this passes none. ``_GIT_ENV_ALLOWLIST`` deliberately does

        GitHub credential into an environment that ``agentic.executor`` runs

        setup-git`` configures), or it fails. A token-only environment with no
