"""Cloud-parity ``ProposerClient`` wrapping a gated chat model.

``agentic.real_repo_loop.run_real_repo_loop`` accepts anything satisfying
``ProposerClient`` (a ``Protocol``: ``invoke(...)``/``close()``); this module is
the second implementation of that contract, alongside
``agentic.harness_optimizer.model_adapter.LocalProposerClient``. Where the local
client is a direct httpx POST to an OpenAI-compatible ``/chat/completions``
endpoint, this one drives a LangChain ``BaseChatModel`` built by
``agentic.deepagent_github.model_adapter.build_chat_model`` -- the same
provider-gated construction the (still-dormant) deepagents harness already
uses, so the same six-gate cloud-provider chain (see ``docs/THREAT_MODEL.md``)
can cover a real git-commit loop, not only that unexercised graph.

Gating (``agentic.enabled``, ``deepagent_github.enabled``,
``allow_cloud_providers``, ``providers.<name>.enabled``, the provider's API
key, and the per-run ``--confirm-online``) is entirely the CALLER's
responsibility. Note those first two: an earlier version of this docstring
said ``mode == "hybrid"``, which is the CORE GRAPH's I3 gate and is read by
nothing under ``agentic/`` -- an operator treating ``app.mode: offline`` as a
global egress kill switch would have been wrong for this plane -- exactly like ``LocalProposerClient``,
this class only egresses; it never decides whether it is allowed to. Callers
construct it from an already-gated ``DeepAgentModelSettings`` (see
``DeepAgentModelSettings.from_config``'s own gate-3/4 assertion, and
``build_chat_model``'s own gate-5 key check).

Every outbound user prompt is scanned and redacted via
``agentic.deepagent_github.handoff.sanitize_handoff`` before it leaves the
process -- that call itself records the ``agentic_deepagent_cloud_handoff``
audit event, so this module does not duplicate it.

Verified (not merely read from source): the exact pinned versions
(``langchain-xai==1.2.2``, ``langchain-anthropic==1.4.8``) were installed into
an isolated venv and driven end-to-end with an injected transport/fake client
-- no network, no provider account. Both confirm ``max_tokens``/``temperature``
passed as ``.invoke()`` kwargs reach the real outbound payload: ``ChatXAI``
inherits ``langchain_openai.BaseChatOpenAI._get_request_payload``, which does
``payload = {**self._default_params, **kwargs}`` (invoke-time kwargs win);
``ChatAnthropic._get_request_payload`` builds its payload the same way and
passes it to ``self._client.messages.create(**payload)``. Also confirmed: a
single-block Claude reply's ``AIMessage.content`` is a plain ``str``, but a
multi-block reply's is a real ``list[dict]`` shaped
``[{"type": "text", "text": ...}, ...]`` -- exactly what
``_coerce_text_content`` below is written to handle, not a hypothetical. See
``tests/test_agentic_cloud_chat_model_wire_format.py``, which runs this same
check as a permanent regression test in the ``deepagents-harness`` CI lane
(the only one with both optional SDKs installed) rather than a one-off manual
verification that would otherwise evaporate.
