"""Command-line entry point: ``python -m agentic.cli <subcommand>``.

Subcommands:

    status         Print agentic config + gh availability + registry summary.
    context        Fetch read-only GitHub context (--pr N | --issue N | --repo).
    propose-skill  Preview a skills-registry change (never writes).
    apply-skill    Apply a skills-registry change (governed; needs --reason).
    deepagent-plan Probe the (retired, no further dev planned) Deep Agents
                   harness (read-only; --provider needs --confirm-online
                   before any cloud egress).
    real-repo-run        Clone a real repo and run plan/patch/verify against it
                          (governed by --reason/--confirm; never commits). Local
                          model by default; --provider needs --confirm-online
                          before any cloud egress.
    real-repo-run-status  Report a real-repo run's persisted status.
    real-repo-run-decide  Approve (commit) or reject (discard) a pending run.
    real-repo-run-push    Push an approved run's branch to origin (its own
                          decision; gated on allow_git_write_tools).
    real-repo-run-publish Open a draft PR for a pushed run (its own decision;
                          ships permanently disarmed by EXECUTION_ENABLED).
    real-repo-run-discard Reclaim a decided (or orphaned) run's clone from disk.
    test           Run the pre-flight self-test.

Exit codes:
    0    success (also the clean no-op when agentic.enabled is false)
    2    operation failed (gh error, registry error)
    3    config / environment problem (gh missing, config invalid)
    4    a write was refused by the gate

This module never imports gate.py, graph.py, or mcp_hybrid_server.py.
