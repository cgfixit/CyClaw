"""CyClaw filesystem connector -- out-of-band, opt-in, human-governed.

Local filesystem / SMB-share access for the air-gapped ICP. Read ops are scoped to
allow-listed roots; writes are confined to a SEPARATE ``writable_roots`` list, gated
(``writes_enabled`` + human reason + confirm), and disabled by default. The connector
is content-agnostic -- it never calls the LLM -- and runs strictly via
``python -m agentic.fsconnect.cli``. It is NEVER imported by gate.py, graph.py, or
mcp_hybrid_server.py; that isolation preserves CyClaw's five security invariants.
