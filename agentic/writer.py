"""GitHub WRITE scaffold for the agentic layer -- DISABLED and STUBBED in v0.1.

This module deliberately CANNOT mutate GitHub state. It exists to (a) document
the exact gate a future write capability must pass, and (b) let tests prove that
the gate refuses every under-satisfied request. Wiring real execution is a
separate, individually-reviewed change behind the same gate.

The gate is the out-of-band analogue of CyClaw's "Triple-Gated External Access"
invariant for the Grok path. A write *plan* is produced only when ALL of:

    1. cfg.mode == "write"            (operator put the layer in write mode)
    2. cfg.writes_enabled is True     (explicit second flag, defaults False)
    3. a non-empty human ``reason``   (governance: no anonymous mutations)
    4. confirm is True                (explicit per-call confirmation)

are satisfied simultaneously. Even then, ``plan_write`` returns a DRY-RUN plan
(the argv it *would* run) and never executes it -- ``EXECUTION_ENABLED`` is a
hard ``False`` and the one place that would execute raises ``NotImplementedError``.
Any gate failure raises ``AgenticWriteRefused`` and is audited.
