"""GitHub WRITE gate for the agentic layer -- implemented, shipped disarmed.

Until P10 this module could not mutate GitHub state at all: ``execute_write``
was a stub that raised ``NotImplementedError``. It is now implemented for
exactly one operation (``pr_create``, always ``--draft``), behind the same gate
this module has always documented. ``pr_comment`` and ``issue_comment`` remain
plan-only: they are describable but not executable, and reaching them through
:func:`execute_write` is a typed refusal, not a silent no-op.

The capability ships DISARMED. ``EXECUTION_ENABLED`` is still ``False`` -- see
its comment for why P10 implemented the executor without flipping it -- and
three independent ``config.yaml`` gates fail closed on a shipped checkout. Arming
it is a documented operator procedure, not a code change:
``docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md``.

The gate is the out-of-band analogue of CyClaw's "Triple-Gated External Access"
invariant for the Grok path. A write is permitted only when the master switch
and all four numbered gates hold:

    0. cfg.enabled is True             (the agentic layer's own master switch)
    1. cfg.mode == "write"              (operator put the layer in write mode)
    2. cfg.writes_enabled is True       (explicit second flag, defaults False)
    3. a non-empty human ``reason``     (governance: no anonymous mutations)
    4. confirm is True                  (explicit per-call confirmation)

are satisfied simultaneously. The shipped ``config.yaml`` fails 0, 1, and 2
independently (``agentic.enabled: false``, ``mode: "read"``,
``writes_enabled: false``), so enabling a write is three deliberate operator
edits, not one.

WHY :func:`execute_write` RE-RUNS THE GATE. Before P10 the gate lived only in
:func:`plan_write`, and :func:`execute_write` took a plain ``dict`` and checked
nothing but ``EXECUTION_ENABLED``. That was sound only while the flag was a
hard ``False`` -- with it flipped, "holding a plan dict" would have BECOME the
authority to write, and a plan is just data: it can be built by hand, come back
from JSON, or cross a process boundary. So the executor now takes the config
AND a fresh ``confirm`` and re-runs the master switch plus all four gates
itself, and rebuilds the argv from the plan's semantic fields rather than
executing the ``would_run`` list it was handed. A tampered ``would_run`` is
inert, and a plan that merely *claims* it was confirmed is not treated as
confirmed -- the caller of ``execute_write`` must confirm again, at execution
time, in its own right.

Any gate failure raises ``AgenticWriteRefused`` and is audited.

# EXECUTION SWITCH -- ships False, and P10 deliberately did NOT flip it.
#
# Through P9 this flag carried the whole safety story: the executor behind it
# was unimplemented, so "flipping the flag is not sufficient" was literally
# true. P10 implements the executor for pr_create, which makes that sentence
# false and leaves this flag as a real switch rather than a label on a stub.
#
# It stays False because flipping it is the one step this repo's own governance
# reserves for a human. docs/agentic/DEEP_AGENT_HARNESS_PHASES_6_9.md requires
# "a separate human security review for any request to add ... GitHub
# mutation", and the directly analogous fsconnect enablement shipped its code
# with the flag off plus a checklist stating "no sign-off, no flag flip". The
# same shape is honored here: see docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md.
#
# Flipping this to True is now genuinely sufficient to arm the capability --
# but not to perform a write. Three shipped config gates still fail closed
# (agentic.enabled, agentic.mode, agentic.writes_enabled), and execute_write()
# re-checks the master switch plus all four numbered gates on every call --
# including confirm, which its caller must supply fresh, not read off the

    ``cfg`` is REQUIRED, not optional, and that is the security design rather
    than an ergonomic accident: this function re-runs the same four gates
    :func:`plan_write` did, against the live config, so possessing a plan dict
    is not itself authority to write. A plan is data -- hand-buildable, JSON
    round-trippable, capable of crossing a process boundary -- and before P10
    the only thing standing between such a dict and a real mutation was
    ``EXECUTION_ENABLED`` being a hard ``False``.

    ``confirm`` is likewise REQUIRED, keyword-only, and NOT read from the plan.
    An earlier version of this function manufactured ``confirm=True``
    internally when re-running the gate, which made gate 4 -- "explicit
    per-call confirmation" -- unconditionally satisfied and therefore not a
    real gate at the execution boundary at all. Nor is ``plan["confirm"]`` an
    acceptable substitute: ``plan_write`` never stores a ``confirm`` field on
    the plan for exactly the same reason it must not be trusted here -- a
    boolean baked into hand-buildable, JSON round-trippable data would be at
    least as forgeable as the manufactured constant it would replace. The
    caller of ``execute_write`` -- the actual human-facing decision point --
    must supply a fresh ``True`` of its own.

    The argv is REBUILT here from the plan's ``op``/``params`` via the same
    builder the planner used; ``plan["would_run"]`` is never executed. It is
    compared against the rebuilt argv and a mismatch is a typed refusal, so a
    tampered or stale plan fails loudly instead of running something the gate
    never saw.

    No retry. See ``DEFAULT_WRITE_TIMEOUT_SEC``: a timeout here means the
