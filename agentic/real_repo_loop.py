"""Real-repo coding loop: plan -> patch -> verify -> (human decides) -> commit.

Fuses three pieces that, until now, existed independently and never called
each other (see ``docs/THREAT_MODEL.md``'s executor amendments): the
planner's model call (behind the ``ProposerClient`` protocol below --
``agentic.harness_optimizer.model_adapter.LocalProposerClient`` for the local,
default path, already proven via the fixture-based loop driver, or
``agentic.deepagent_github.chat_client.ChatModelProposerClient`` for a
triple-gated cloud provider), a real jailed clone with local git write ops
(``agentic.deepagent_github.repo_workspace.RepoWorkspaceTools``), and the
sandboxed verification executor (``agentic.executor.run_verification``).
This module is the first live caller of ``run_verification``, and the first
thing in this codebase that can turn a model's proposal into an actual git
commit against a real repository -- still local only: no push, no PR, no
GitHub API call of any kind.

``run_real_repo_loop`` stops the moment a candidate passes its own gates --
it does NOT commit. Committing is a separate, later call to
:func:`finalize_real_repo_change`, driven by an explicit human
``approve``/``reject`` decision. This is deliberate: every other write path
in this codebase (``agentic/writer.py``, ``apply_skill``) puts a human
confirmation between "this passed its checks" and "this is now written," and
a real git commit against a real repository is exactly the write this
discipline should apply to least of all skip. The split also happens to be
what makes this pipeline usable from a stateless CLI-subprocess-per-call
caller (see ``RepoWorkspaceTools.attach``): the process that ran the loop can
exit after persisting where the clone lives, and a LATER process can
reattach to it once a human decides.

Deliberately a TOP-LEVEL ``agentic`` module, not nested inside either
``agentic.harness_optimizer`` or ``agentic.deepagent_github``: it imports from
both, and putting it inside either package's own ``__init__.py`` import chain
would risk the exact circular import ``agentic/harness_optimizer/loop_driver.py``'s
own docstring documents finding and fixing (``agentic.deepagent_github.tools``
imports ``agentic.harness_optimizer.mcp.tools``, so anything either
subpackage's ``__init__.py`` imports that reaches back into the other blows up
the moment something imports ``agentic.deepagent_github``). Living outside
both, this module can safely import from either without ever being imported
BY either at package-init time.

Governance mirrors ``agentic/writer.py``'s shape rather than
``harness_optimizer.core.decide_candidate``: this is a genuinely different
kind of acceptance decision. ``decide_candidate`` assumes a declared
``Experiment`` with ``train_visible``/``holdout_hidden`` fixture cases and
would always reject a real-repo candidate outright (empty case tuples make
``train_passed``/``holdout_passed`` permanently ``False``) -- there is no such
thing as a "holdout case" for an arbitrary real repository, only "did the
repo's own tests/lints pass." So acceptance here is a new, smaller, separately
tested decision function (``decide_real_repo_candidate``) with its own gate
vocabulary, not a repurposing of ``decide_candidate``.

Gated on THREE things, checked once up front, mirroring ``agentic/writer.py``'s
"no anonymous mutations" governance principle rather than
``RepoWorkspaceTools``'s own lower-level per-call check (which still applies
too, redundantly, at every ``write_file``/``add``/``commit`` call):

    1. ``deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools`` is ``True``
    2. a non-empty human ``reason`` string
    3. explicit ``confirm=True``

The planner defaults to a local model (``LocalProposerClient``, whatever
``agentic.deepagent_github``'s ``provider``/``base_url``/``model`` config
names -- Ollama by default). A caller MAY instead supply a
``ChatModelProposerClient`` wrapping a gated cloud provider (Grok or Claude,
behind the same six-condition chain the deepagents harness uses) -- this
function itself does not choose or gate the provider; it accepts anything
satisfying ``ProposerClient`` and calls only ``invoke``/``close`` on it.

Wired to ``agentic.cli``'s ``real-repo-run``/``real-repo-run-status``/
``real-repo-run-decide`` subcommands, and from there to the harness's
authenticated agent-run routes (``harness/server.py``, via
``utils.ops_runner``'s CLI-subprocess shim -- never a direct import, per I6).
``cmd_real_repo_run_decide``'s own ``--push``/``--publish`` flags now call
``RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch``/``agentic.writer.execute_write`` (this
module itself still does not -- that orchestration lives in ``agentic.cli``,
not here, since it is a decide-time escalation the CLI layer chooses, not
part of the loop's own plan/patch/verify/commit contract). Both remain
disarmed on a shipped checkout: push needs
``deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools`` (ships ``false``), and publish
needs ``agentic.writer.EXECUTION_ENABLED`` (a hardcoded ``False`` in source,
not a config value) in addition to its own four gates. Arming either is a
separate, deliberate operator act -- see
``docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md`` -- not a side effect of this
wiring existing.

    """Run plan -> patch -> verify -> commit against a real, jailed clone.

    ``tools`` must already be an open ``RepoWorkspaceTools.clone(...)`` result
    -- this function does not own its lifecycle (unlike the fixture-based
    loop driver, a real clone is an expensive, disk-consuming resource the
    caller constructed and must eventually ``close()``, whether this run
    accepts or not).

    ``checks`` is REQUIRED, not defaulted: ``agentic.executor.default_checks``
    assumes THIS repo's own toolchain (pytest/ruff/the invariant guard at a
    CyClaw-specific path) and is only appropriate when the configured target
    happens to be this same repository. For any other repository, guessing a
    test/lint command would be exactly the kind of invented default this
    codebase avoids -- the caller must state what "passing" means for the
    repo it configured. An empty sequence is rejected outright: it would make
    ``run_verification`` vacuously report ``ok=True`` regardless of what was
    actually written, silently defeating the entire gate.

    ``commit_message`` is a caller-supplied, fixed string, never raw planner
    output -- never derived from a model response, only from what the caller
    (a human-reviewed task description) provides.

    ``context`` is an optional, caller-prepared, ALREADY governance-scanned
    block of task context (e.g. a PR/issue title, body, and diff) folded into
    every iteration's prompt alongside the instruction. It is intentionally
    just text handed to a single-shot prompt, not a live read surface: the
    planner still cannot browse the clone or request specific files mid-loop
    (that would be a materially different, tool-calling design, not attempted
    here). Without it the planner sees only ``instruction`` and any prior
    rejection feedback, which is sufficient for "create this new file" tasks
    but not for "edit this existing code to do X" ones -- the caller decides
    whether it has task context worth passing; this function does no fetching
    of its own.

    ``read_paths`` is an optional, caller-declared list of repo-relative paths
    whose CURRENT content is read fresh from the clone and shown in every
    iteration's prompt (see ``_render_existing_files``). This is what makes
    "edit this existing code" survivable: the planner protocol is whole-file
    replacement, so a model asked to change a file it has never seen has no
    choice but to reconstruct it from memory, silently destroying whatever it
    gets wrong. It is still not a live read surface -- the operator declares
    the paths up front; the planner cannot browse the clone or request a
    different file mid-loop, matching ``context``'s own single-shot-prompt
    design.

    As a backstop independent of whether ``read_paths`` was used correctly, a
    proposed write to a path that ALREADY EXISTS on disk, was not among
    ``read_paths``, AND was never written by an earlier iteration of THIS
    SAME loop is refused (as ``file_write_failed``, the same gate an
    individual ``write_file`` error already uses) rather than silently
    overwriting content the model was never shown. The "written by an earlier
    iteration of this loop" exemption is required, not optional: the clone
    persists across iterations with no reset, so a file iteration 1 wrote (even
    if that iteration was rejected) is expected to be freely rewritten by
    iteration 2 based on textual rejection feedback alone -- that is the
    entire iterate-on-feedback design, and it must not require re-declaring
    the same path via ``read_paths`` on every subsequent attempt. A path that
    does not exist at all is unaffected -- creating a new file needs no prior
    read.

    ``protected_write_paths`` (path prefixes/filenames -- see
    ``_matches_protected_path``) and ``max_write_budget_bytes`` are the
    diff-scope gate: a candidate that writes into a protected path, or whose
    total proposed write size exceeds the budget, is quarantined the same way
    a critical governance finding is -- nothing is written, verification does
    not run, and the iteration is rejected. This closes the reward-hacking
    hazard a make-the-checks-pass loop otherwise has no defense against: with
    no scope gate, a candidate could rewrite the very tests judging it and be
    "accepted" by construction. Both empty/``None`` (the defaults) disable the
    respective check -- the caller supplies them from config, never a hardcoded
    invented default.
