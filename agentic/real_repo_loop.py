"""Real-repo coding loop: plan -> patch -> verify -> (human decides) -> commit.

Fuses three pieces that, until now, existed independently and never called
each other (see ``docs/THREAT_MODEL.md``'s executor amendments): the
planner's model call (behind the ``ProposerClient`` protocol below --
``agentic.harness_optimizer.model_adapter.LocalProposerClient`` for the local,
default path, already proven via the fixture-based loop driver, or
``agentic.deepagent_github.chat_client.ChatModelProposerClient`` for a
triple-gated cloud provider), a real jailed clone with local git write ops
(``agentic.deepagent_github.repo_workspace.RepoWorkspaceTools``), and the
sandboxed verification executor (``agentic.executor.run_verification``).
This module is the first live caller of ``run_verification``, and the first
thing in this codebase that can turn a model's proposal into an actual git
commit against a real repository -- still local only: no push, no PR, no
GitHub API call of any kind.

``run_real_repo_loop`` stops the moment a candidate passes its own gates --
it does NOT commit. Committing is a separate, later call to
:func:`finalize_real_repo_change`, driven by an explicit human
``approve``/``reject`` decision. This is deliberate: every other write path
in this codebase (``agentic/writer.py``, ``apply_skill``) puts a human
confirmation between "this passed its checks" and "this is now written," and
a real git commit against a real repository is exactly the write this
discipline should apply to least of all skip. The split also happens to be
what makes this pipeline usable from a stateless CLI-subprocess-per-call
caller (see ``RepoWorkspaceTools.attach``): the process that ran the loop can
exit after persisting where the clone lives, and a LATER process can
reattach to it once a human decides.

Deliberately a TOP-LEVEL ``agentic`` module, not nested inside either
``agentic.harness_optimizer`` or ``agentic.deepagent_github``: it imports from
both, and putting it inside either package's own ``__init__.py`` import chain
would risk the exact circular import ``agentic/harness_optimizer/loop_driver.py``'s
own docstring documents finding and fixing (``agentic.deepagent_github.tools``
imports ``agentic.harness_optimizer.mcp.tools``, so anything either
subpackage's ``__init__.py`` imports that reaches back into the other blows up
the moment something imports ``agentic.deepagent_github``). Living outside
both, this module can safely import from either without ever being imported
BY either at package-init time.

Governance mirrors ``agentic/writer.py``'s shape rather than
``harness_optimizer.core.decide_candidate``: this is a genuinely different
kind of acceptance decision. ``decide_candidate`` assumes a declared
``Experiment`` with ``train_visible``/``holdout_hidden`` fixture cases and
would always reject a real-repo candidate outright (empty case tuples make
``train_passed``/``holdout_passed`` permanently ``False``) -- there is no such
thing as a "holdout case" for an arbitrary real repository, only "did the
repo's own tests/lints pass." So acceptance here is a new, smaller, separately
tested decision function (``decide_real_repo_candidate``) with its own gate
vocabulary, not a repurposing of ``decide_candidate``.

Gated on THREE things, checked once up front, mirroring ``agentic/writer.py``'s
"no anonymous mutations" governance principle rather than
``RepoWorkspaceTools``'s own lower-level per-call check (which still applies
too, redundantly, at every ``write_file``/``add``/``commit`` call):

    1. ``deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools`` is ``True``
    2. a non-empty human ``reason`` string
    3. explicit ``confirm=True``

The planner defaults to a local model (``LocalProposerClient``, whatever
``agentic.deepagent_github``'s ``provider``/``base_url``/``model`` config
names -- Ollama by default). A caller MAY instead supply a
``ChatModelProposerClient`` wrapping a gated cloud provider (Grok or Claude,
behind the same six-condition chain the deepagents harness uses) -- this
function itself does not choose or gate the provider; it accepts anything
satisfying ``ProposerClient`` and calls only ``invoke``/``close`` on it.

Wired to ``agentic.cli``'s ``real-repo-run``/``real-repo-run-status``/
``real-repo-run-decide`` subcommands. ``utils.ops_runner`` carries the same
actions as a CLI-subprocess shim (never a direct import, per I6), but no HTTP
route accepts them today, so the pipeline is CLI-only.
``cmd_real_repo_run_decide``'s own ``--push``/``--publish`` flags now call
``RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch``/``agentic.writer.execute_write`` (this
module itself still does not -- that orchestration lives in ``agentic.cli``,
not here, since it is a decide-time escalation the CLI layer chooses, not
part of the loop's own plan/patch/verify/commit contract). Both remain gated
on a shipped checkout, but by different things than they once were: push needs
``deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools`` (still ships ``false``), while
publish's code-level gate ``agentic.writer.EXECUTION_ENABLED`` ships ``True``
since the operator enablement of 2026-08-07 -- so publish is held by the layer
master switch (``agentic.enabled``, ships ``false``) and its own per-call
``reason``/``confirm``, not by that constant. Arming either is a separate,
deliberate operator act -- see ``docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md``,
including the ``CYCLAW_AGENTIC_WRITE_DISABLE`` rollback -- not a side effect of
this wiring existing.

    Re-reads from disk on every call rather than caching: the clone persists

    earlier iteration must show that iteration's actual result, not a stale
    snapshot from before the loop started -- consistent with ``feedback``
    already being "ground to iterate FROM," not a fresh start each time.

    A path that does not exist is silently omitted, not an error: an operator
    may legitimately declare ``--read-file`` for a file that does not exist
    yet (e.g. "create tests/test_x.py alongside editing src/x.py"), and the
    absence itself is a valid signal ("this is a create, not an edit").

    Bounded per-file and in total (see ``_MAX_READ_FILE_CHARS``/
    ``_MAX_TOTAL_READ_CHARS``) for the same reason ``agentic/cli.py``'s
    ``_MAX_LOOP_CONTEXT_CHARS`` exists: CLAUDE.md's documented Ollama
    ``num_ctx`` footgun means an unbounded read can silently stall the whole

    Returns the rendered prompt text AND the set of canonical paths whose
    FULL content actually made it into that text. The two are NOT the same as
    ``read_paths``: a path can be declared and still be absent from the
    returned set for three reasons -- it doesn't exist yet (a legitimate
    create); the running ``_MAX_TOTAL_READ_CHARS`` total was already spent by
    earlier files, so it gets only the bare "omitted" marker below, no
    content at all; or its own content exceeded ``_MAX_READ_FILE_CHARS`` and
    was truncated. The caller MUST gate write-permission on this returned
    set, not on raw declaration: a path the model was told exists but never
    actually shown -- in full -- is exactly the blind-overwrite scenario the
    caller's backstop exists to catch. Checking only "was it declared" misses
    the budget-omitted case entirely (a model that declares enough large
    files to exhaust the total budget could otherwise "unlock" write access
    to a file it never saw a single byte of); checking "was it rendered at
    all" still misses the truncated case, since the whole point of this
    function's caller is to justify a WHOLE-FILE replacement -- a model that
    saw only the first ``_MAX_READ_FILE_CHARS`` characters cannot honestly
    reconstruct what comes after them, so a truncated render does not earn

    ``tools`` must already be an open ``RepoWorkspaceTools.clone(...)`` result
    -- this function does not own its lifecycle (unlike the fixture-based
    loop driver, a real clone is an expensive, disk-consuming resource the
    caller constructed and must eventually ``close()``, whether this run
    accepts or not).

    ``checks`` is REQUIRED, not defaulted: ``agentic.executor.default_checks``
    assumes THIS repo's own toolchain (pytest/ruff/the invariant guard at a
    CyClaw-specific path) and is only appropriate when the configured target
    happens to be this same repository. For any other repository, guessing a
    test/lint command would be exactly the kind of invented default this
    codebase avoids -- the caller must state what "passing" means for the
    repo it configured. An empty sequence is rejected outright: it would make
    ``run_verification`` vacuously report ``ok=True`` regardless of what was
    actually written, silently defeating the entire gate.

    ``commit_message`` is a caller-supplied, fixed string, never raw planner
    output -- never derived from a model response, only from what the caller
    (a human-reviewed task description) provides.

    ``context`` is an optional, caller-prepared, ALREADY governance-scanned
    block of task context (e.g. a PR/issue title, body, and diff) folded into
    every iteration's prompt alongside the instruction. It is intentionally
    just text handed to a single-shot prompt, not a live read surface: the
    planner still cannot browse the clone or request specific files mid-loop
    (that would be a materially different, tool-calling design, not attempted
    here). Without it the planner sees only ``instruction`` and any prior
    rejection feedback, which is sufficient for "create this new file" tasks
    but not for "edit this existing code to do X" ones -- the caller decides
    whether it has task context worth passing; this function does no fetching
    of its own.

    ``read_paths`` is an optional, caller-declared list of repo-relative paths
    whose CURRENT content is read fresh from the clone and shown in every
    iteration's prompt (see ``_render_existing_files``). This is what makes
    "edit this existing code" survivable: the planner protocol is whole-file
    replacement, so a model asked to change a file it has never seen has no
    choice but to reconstruct it from memory, silently destroying whatever it
    gets wrong. It is still not a live read surface -- the operator declares
    the paths up front; the planner cannot browse the clone or request a
    different file mid-loop, matching ``context``'s own single-shot-prompt
    design.

    As a backstop independent of whether ``read_paths`` was used correctly, a
    proposed write to a path that ALREADY EXISTS on disk, was not among
    ``read_paths``, AND was never written by an earlier iteration of THIS
    SAME loop is refused (as ``file_write_failed``, the same gate an
    individual ``write_file`` error already uses) rather than silently
    overwriting content the model was never shown. The "written by an earlier
    iteration of this loop" exemption is required, not optional: the clone
    persists across iterations with no reset, so a file iteration 1 wrote (even
    if that iteration was rejected) is expected to be freely rewritten by
    iteration 2 based on textual rejection feedback alone -- that is the
    entire iterate-on-feedback design, and it must not require re-declaring
    the same path via ``read_paths`` on every subsequent attempt. A path that
    does not exist at all is unaffected -- creating a new file needs no prior
    read.

    ``protected_write_paths`` (path prefixes/filenames -- see
    ``_matches_protected_path``) and ``max_write_budget_bytes`` are the
    diff-scope gate: a candidate that writes into a protected path, or whose
    total proposed write size exceeds the budget, is quarantined the same way
    a critical governance finding is -- nothing is written, verification does
    not run, and the iteration is rejected. This closes the reward-hacking
    hazard a make-the-checks-pass loop otherwise has no defense against: with
    no scope gate, a candidate could rewrite the very tests judging it and be
    "accepted" by construction. Both empty/``None`` (the defaults) disable the
    respective check -- the caller supplies them from config, never a hardcoded
    invented default.

    """Materialize or discard an already-accepted real-repo candidate.

    This is the human gate: ``run_real_repo_loop`` already ran the caller's
    own verification checks and decided the candidate passes, but it stops
    short of committing so a human can review the diff first
    (``tools.diff()``, surfaced by ``agentic.cli``'s
    ``real-repo-run-status`` for exactly this purpose) -- exactly the same
    shape every other write path in this codebase uses
    (``agentic/writer.py``'s reason+confirm gate, ``apply_skill``'s
    ``--confirm``): the model's own proposal is never enough on its own,
    regardless of what tests it passed.

    Takes ``branch_name``/``commit_message``/``changed_files`` as plain
    values rather than a ``RealRepoLoopResult`` on purpose: an in-process
    caller has one to unpack, but the more realistic caller -- a later CLI
    invocation that reattached to the clone via ``RepoWorkspaceTools.attach``
    -- has only a persisted JSON record (``agentic.real_repo_run_store``), not
    a live dataclass instance. Both shapes hand this function the same three
    primitives either way.

    ``protected_write_paths`` is required rather than defaulted because the
    ``changed_files`` above are read back from that persisted JSON record, and
    a persisted list is not the list the diff-scope gate cleared. ``run_real_repo_loop``
    checks every proposed path against the protected prefixes at proposal time,
    but between that check and this call the record sits on disk across a
    separate process invocation, during which two ordinary things can happen:
    the operator tightens ``protected_write_paths`` in ``config.yaml`` (the
    likely case -- the policy is meant to be edited), or the record is edited or
    corrupted. ``cmd_real_repo_run_decide`` already re-validates
    ``branch_name``/``commit_message`` off the same record for the same reason
    and says so in its own comment; ``changed_files`` is the third primitive and
    had no equivalent. Re-checking here means the commit a human approves is
    scoped by the policy in force *now*, not the policy that happened to be in
    force when the model proposed. A default of ``()`` would have made every
    existing caller silently skip the check, so there is none.

    Containment is a separate, already-closed concern: ``tools.add`` routes each
    path through ``_validate_write_path``, so nothing here can stage outside the
    clone. This gate is about *policy* scope, not the jail.

    ``decision="reject"`` is an audited no-op: it does not touch git at all.
    The caller is responsible for eventually discarding the clone (e.g.
    ``tools.close()``); this function only records the human's decision.
