"""Read-only SQL client scaffold (Postgres / MSSQL), disabled-by-default.

A SELECT-only guard rejects DDL/DML and stacked statements; ``allow_write`` is
hard False in v0.1. PostgreSQL transactions are read-only; MSSQL ODBC access mode
is advisory. A least-privilege server role is mandatory for both drivers. The
DSN comes from an environment variable only -- never hardcoded.

Driver modules (``psycopg`` / ``pyodbc``) are imported lazily, so a disabled
connector never requires them. The actual connect/execute paths need a live DB and
are ``# pragma: no cover``; the query/identifier guards are pure and fully tested.

Never imported by gate.py / graph.py / mcp_hybrid_server.py.

# NOTE: ``replace`` is deliberately NOT in this list. ``REPLACE`` as a write
# statement is MySQL-only DML, and this connector supports only Postgres/MSSQL,
# where ``replace(...)`` is a read-only scalar string function. Blocking it
# rejected legitimate read queries like ``SELECT replace(name,'a','b') FROM t``.
# Even if a REPLACE write statement existed, the leading-keyword gate (must start
# with SELECT/WITH) plus the single-statement check would already stop it.
# ``updlock``/``holdlock``/``xlock``/``tablock``/``tablockx``/``paglock``/
# ``serializable`` are MSSQL table hints that take write-grade or aggressively
# escalated locks inside an otherwise valid SELECT (``SELECT * FROM t WITH
# (UPDLOCK)``). On a connector whose contract is read-only that is an
# availability risk (blocking other writers/readers), so the hints are
# forbidden even though the statement itself only reads.
#
# The ``pg_``/``lo_``/``dblink`` group extends that same reasoning one step. Every
# name there is read-only *from the database's point of view*, so none of the
# gates above stop it: the statement is a single SELECT, starts with SELECT, has
# no stacked separator, and the read-only session happily executes it. What they
# reach is OUTSIDE the database:
#
#   * ``pg_read_*`` (``pg_read_file``, ``pg_read_binary_file``), ``pg_ls_*``
#     (``pg_ls_dir``, ``pg_ls_waldir``, ...), ``pg_stat_file``, and the
#     large-object ``lo_import`` / ``lo_export`` read (or write) the DB HOST's
#     filesystem -- a file-disclosure primitive dressed as a SELECT. The
#     prefixes are wildcarded because the family keeps growing; ``pg_stat_file``
#     is spelled out rather than ``pg_stat_\w+`` so the harmless catalog views
#     (``pg_stat_activity`` and friends) stay readable. Large-object functions
#     are blocked as a family, including ``lo_get`` and ``lo_put``.
#   * ``dblink*`` opens an outbound connection from the DB host: SSRF plus a
#     second session this connector's read-only enforcement never touches.
#   * ``pg_sleep`` (and the ``pg_terminate_backend``/``pg_cancel_backend`` pair)
#     is the availability argument the MSSQL lock hints above are already
#     blocked for, one line over.
#
# Some of these are available to ordinary roles. The lexical guard is defense
# in depth, not a replacement for server privileges: arbitrary user-defined
# functions can have effects that their names do not reveal. ``\w*`` on the prefixes catches
# the family members (``dblink_connect``, ``dblink_send_query``) that a bare
# ``\b`` would let through, since ``_`` is a word character.
#
# ``openrowset``/``openquery``/``opendatasource`` are the MSSQL analogue of the
# same problem: each is a single, valid, read-only ``SELECT ... FROM
# OPENROWSET(...)`` that reaches OUTSIDE the database -- OPENROWSET(BULK ...)
# reads an arbitrary file off the DB host, and both OPENROWSET's ad-hoc
# connection string and OPENQUERY's linked-server target can point at an
# internal address (SSRF), same shape as ``dblink`` above. They belong in this
# regex rather than _FORBIDDEN_FN_RE below because they are T-SQL keyword
# syntax, not schema-qualified callable identifiers: unlike a Postgres function
# name, bracket-quoting one (``FROM [OPENROWSET](...)``) makes SQL Server parse
# it as an object reference and fails, it does not invoke the row-set function
# -- so there is no quoted-identifier bypass to guard against here, the same
# reasoning already applied to the ``updlock``/``holdlock`` MSSQL hints above.

# blanked out to avoid false-rejecting valid read queries. Real DML, comments and
# stacked statements always live OUTSIDE quotes, so the ``WITH (DELETE ... RETURNING)``
# CTE bypass and ``--``/``/* */`` comment hiding are still caught.
#
# This MUST be a single left-to-right scan rather than a regex alternation.
# The previous ``re.sub`` of ``'...'|"..."`` did not know about the other
# quoting forms, so a quote character sitting INSIDE one of them opened a

#
#     SELECT $$'$$ ; DROP TABLE t ; SELECT $$'$$

# Quoting rules are per-DIALECT, not a union of both. Applying one dialect's

# blanks everything up to the next such character, and the ``;``/comment/keyword
# checks below never see the statement hidden in between. Both directions were

#

#         SELECT 1 AS a$x$ ; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami' ; SELECT 1 AS b$x$
#     postgres, ``[`` is array subscript (``]]`` ends a nested array literal):
#         SELECT ARRAY[ARRAY[1]] ; COPY (SELECT 1) TO PROGRAM 'id' ; SELECT ARRAY[1]
#
# Each was accepted as a single SELECT. Selecting per driver is strictly
# fail-closed -- dropping an inapplicable opener blanks LESS text, so the guards
# see MORE of the statement and can only reject more, never less.
