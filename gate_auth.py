"""Per-user authentication endpoints (docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md, Stage 2+3).

``/auth/login``, ``/auth/logout``, ``/auth/whoami`` -- registered onto
gate.py's app the same way gate_ops.py registers ``/ops/*``: a registration
function taking the security callables already defined in gate.py. Auth is
core request-path functionality, not out-of-band like agentic/sync/guardrails,
but the split still keeps gate.py from growing without bound and reuses an
established pattern rather than inventing a new one.

When ``auth.enabled`` is false (the shipped default) every ``/auth/*`` route
below returns 503 rather than 404, so the routes' mere presence never
discloses whether the feature is turned on -- the same reasoning
gate_ops.py's routes stay registered regardless of ``agentic.enabled``.

``require_session_or_token`` is a closure built inside ``register_auth_routes``.
Stage 3 attaches it to ``POST /query`` only when ``auth_manager`` is not None
(via ``attach_identity_to_query``). gate.py's bind-guard probe locates it by
NAME (``_AUTH_DEPENDENCY_NAME``). A named no-op on the disabled default would
false-open a LAN bind, so the shipped app (auth off) does not carry it.
