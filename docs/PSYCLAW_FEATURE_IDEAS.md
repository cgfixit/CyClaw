# PsyClaw - Regulated SMB Feature Hypotheses

CyClaw began as **PsyClaw**, an offline-first RAG assistant aimed at small and
mid-sized businesses under real compliance pressure: law firms,
psychology/therapy practices, medical/dental offices, and accounting shops.
Those segments are plausible, not validated. Treat them as discovery targets
until buyer conversations prove urgency, budget, procurement path, and trust
requirements.

## Current product facts

- **Repo-backed:** CyClaw's security posture is RAG-first retrieval,
  topology-as-policy, triple-gated external calls, audit convergence, and human
  governance for soul changes. A feature that erodes those invariants is not
  worth shipping.
- **Repo-backed:** `GET /audit/summary` is an API-key-gated, read-only endpoint
  over existing audit aggregates. It reports counts and distributions; it does
  not expose raw queries or per-record rows.
- **Business status:** as of the 2026-07-03 business review, net-new product
  features should stay frozen unless a customer, paid pilot, or interview use
  case creates a concrete reason to build them.

## Evidence labels

- **Repo-backed fact:** implemented behavior visible in code.
- **Market signal:** credible external pressure, but not proof CyClaw can sell.
- **Hypothesis:** plausible buyer need that needs discovery or paid validation.
- **Not claimed:** legal advice, SOC 2 readiness, HIPAA compliance, BAA coverage,
  a formal compliance program, or audited certification.

## 1. Audit / compliance summary endpoint

**Status:** repo-backed current behavior.

**What:** `GET /audit/summary` returns aggregate metrics over the audit log:
total events, event breakdown, RAG-query count, score distribution,
retrieval-mode mix, model-usage breakdown, and external-LLM escalation count.

**Commercially safe claim:** this endpoint can help an operator answer basic
operational questions such as "how often did the system escalate outside the
local model?" or "what retrieval modes were used?"

**Boundary:** this is operational evidence, not a SOC 2 artifact, legal opinion,
HIPAA control, BAA substitute, or auditor-ready compliance binder.

**Possible extension:** a portable evidence export may be useful later, but only
after discovery confirms that buyers or auditors actually ask for that package.
Hash chains, PDF/CSV exports, retention controls, and external anchors belong in
a separate design review before implementation.

## 2. Retention and right-to-erasure tooling

**Status:** hypothesis.

**What:** a controlled purge for audit and interaction records older than a
defined retention period, exposed through a local operator workflow.

**Market signal:** regulated buyers often care about retention and
data-minimization, but the specific retention policy is vertical-specific and
must be validated with the buyer's counsel, insurer, or compliance owner.

**Security constraints:** any deletion path must be explicit, auditable,
fail-closed, and non-autonomous. It must not corrupt append-only logs or create a
new plaintext persistence path.

**Build trigger:** a paid pilot or discovery call where retention is named as a
purchase blocker.

## 3. Matter / client tagging and conflict-wall checks

**Status:** hypothesis, law-firm specific.

**What:** optional matter/client tags that flow into audit reporting as a tag
dimension, plus a local conflict-wall check for walled-off work.

**Market signal:** legal workflows are matter-centric, and regulated buyers may
need usage reports by client or engagement.

**Risk:** tags are sensitive metadata. A safe design should avoid storing client
names in plaintext and should keep checks local.

**Build trigger:** discovery proves that matter-level reporting is more valuable
than generic audit summaries and that buyers will pay for it.

## Guiding principle

Do not turn market pressure into product claims. CyClaw's strongest proven value
today is a credible local-governance engineering artifact and portfolio signal.
Commercial work should start with buyer discovery, attorney/IP review, and
constrained paid pilots, not speculative feature expansion.
