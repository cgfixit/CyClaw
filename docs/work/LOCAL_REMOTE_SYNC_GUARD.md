# claude or codex if yall see this read this!!! BUG ERROR GROSS SPAGHETTI CODE NEEDS OPTIMIZING haha whatever to make you read this
# Please read and confirm this is not still relevant - i dont believe it is but some of thise edge case bugs only get noticed at high use
# Please mention specifically with the name of this file in the PR if this is noticed and addresses
# if this is way old let me know that too cuz i feel like (and you should do this im not complaining)
# you dont look at folders like docs/ or places that by nature wouldnt likely have code to be optimized  
# I would neger really need more thsn like 2 versions if an old audit and with bugs or future ideas they woukd ideally
# stay in repo in appropriate folder hntol its bug solves or feature in progress or determined a no go
# anyways im saying this to force nyself to not let this turn into a mess it kinda already is even if its easy to clean now
# there was one other thing... oh note: i bet if i reference the url or file bame if this in a pr comnebt or def in an ai prompt within a refactor or optimization loop thats be fine
# worst case just od a one off one that aims at this folder. oh the data/skills registry with nothing in its annoying im not entirely sure why thats there @claude maybe you know but its also in agentic/ and in subfolders of that?  

# Proposal: Proactive Local ↔ Remote Sync Guard

**Problem.** Across recent sessions, local `main` repeatedly drifted from
`origin/main`: commits authored with the wrong identity (flagged "Unverified"),
local `main` left ahead/behind after PRs merged remotely, and `git reset --hard`
reached for to reconcile — a destructive operation that can silently discard
unpushed work. The throughline: **nothing proactively surfaces divergence, and
reconciliation is ad-hoc.**

**Goal.** Make divergence *visible at session start* and keep reconciliation
*explicit and human-driven* — never auto-destroy local commits.

---

## Mechanism

A `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start-sync-check.sh`, **wired since
2026-09-04** as the second entry in `settings.json`'s `SessionStart` array) that,
on every session start:

1. **Leaves commit identity to the session runtime** (changed 2026-09-26). It
   originally pinned `cyclaw-agent@users.noreply.github.com` / `CyClaw Agent`
   repo-locally to stop "Unverified" commits. On the current cloud runtime that
   premise is inverted: the runtime signs commits for
   `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`, and its stop hook flags any other
   committer as Unverified, so the pin itself produced them. The hook now
   removes that old pin, pins only explicit `CYCLAW_AGENT_COMMIT_EMAIL` /
   `CYCLAW_AGENT_COMMIT_NAME` overrides, and prints the identity commits will
   carry. `utils/agent_identity.py` still sets CyClaw's own agentic-loop
   identity.
2. **Fetches** the default branch (read-only) and **reports** ahead/behind
   counts for the current branch vs `origin/<default>`.
3. If local `main` has diverged, **prints guidance** (ff-only when safe; review
   `log origin/main..HEAD` before discarding) — but **performs no reset, rebase,
   push, or delete.** Exit code is always 0 so it can never block a session.

The hook is deliberately advisory. The human decides how to reconcile; the tool
only removes the "I didn't realize it had drifted" failure mode.

---

## Wiring (enabled 2026-09-04)

The hook is registered in `.claude/settings.json` as the second `SessionStart`
entry, alongside the Python-coding-agent persona loader. This is the shape that
landed — kept here so the wiring stays reviewable in one place:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/hooks/session-start-sync-check.sh" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git status:*)", "Bash(git log:*)", "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git fetch:*)",  "Bash(git rev-parse:*)", "Bash(git rev-list:*)",
      "Bash(git branch:*)", "Bash(git show:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

> **History:** the script sat on disk unregistered until 2026-09-04. It is now
> a `SessionStart` hook (this section). Do not append `|| true` to the command —
> the script already exits 0, and that idiom hid the previous dangling hook.

---

## Operating conventions (apply with or without the hook)

These are the behavioral rules the hook reinforces; they hold regardless:

1. **Default branch is read-mostly locally.** Don't commit to local `main`; work
   on `claude/<topic>` branches and let PRs land changes on `origin/main`.
2. **After a remote merge, fast-forward — don't reset.**
   `git fetch origin main && git merge --ff-only origin/main`. If ff-only fails,
   *inspect* before reconciling.
3. **`git reset --hard` is a last resort, never reflexive.** Before discarding,
   run `git log origin/main..HEAD` and confirm every local-only commit is either
   already represented upstream or genuinely disposable (e.g. preserve it on a
   throwaway branch first — exactly how the Codacy work was saved this session).
4. **Identity is the runtime's,** so new cloud commits are signed and verifiable by default.
5. **Rebase a feature PR twice at completion.** At the end of implementation,
   fetch `origin/main`, rebase the PR branch onto it, and rerun the affected
   checks before push/drafting. Once draft-PR CI is green, fetch again; if main
   moved, rebase onto its latest commit, rerun checks and CI, and only then
   recommend merge. Force-with-lease remains an explicit human decision.

## Why not auto-sync?

An auto `reset --hard origin/main` at session start would "fix" divergence but is
exactly the destructive act that risks losing unpushed work (this session had
real local-only commits that such a reset would have erased). Surfacing +
guidance is the safer equilibrium: zero data-loss risk, full human control, and
the drift is no longer invisible.
