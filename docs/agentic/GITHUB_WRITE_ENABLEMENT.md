# GitHub Write Enablement — procedure and security review

**Status: NOT ENABLED.** `agentic/writer.py` ships `EXECUTION_ENABLED = False`
and `config.yaml` ships three further gates closed. Nothing in this repository
can open a pull request today. This document is the procedure for changing
that, and the checklist that must be filed first.

> **Checklist re-run in progress (2026-07-31), decisions recorded
> (2026-08-01).** Item A's void-and-re-run clause fired: `execute_write` is
> now reachable from two CLI subcommands and one authenticated HTTP route,
> which it was not when this document was written. Items A and I were
> rewritten accordingly and a dated verification record sits below the
> checklist. The operator has since decided both open items:
>
> - **Item A — sign off as-is.** HTTP reachability is accepted; the shipped
>   mitigations (the six-gate chain, rate limiting ahead of auth, the
>   Origin/Sec-Fetch-Site cross-site guard) are the accepted posture. No
>   further code change (no separate publish-tier credential, no added
>   confirmation factor) is required before signing.
> - **Item H — accept the scope.** The executor-argv gap stays a documented,
>   accepted risk, consistent with the single-operator threat model. No
>   targeted fix (e.g. overriding the executor's git credential helper) is
>   required before signing.
>
> **The status above is still unchanged and still requires an actual
> signature and date on the line below before it changes.** Recording a
> decision on what the checklist SAYS is not the same act as signing it —
> the sign-off line, and the arming steps (procedure steps 5–7, including

> action.

It is the GitHub analogue of `FSCONNECT_WRITE_ENABLEMENT_PLAYBOOK.md` +
`FSCONNECT_SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`, and exists for the same reason: the
code half of an enablement is reviewable in a diff, and the operational half is
not. `DEEP_AGENT_HARNESS_PHASES_6_9.md` independently requires "a separate
human security review for any request to add shell, host filesystem, GitHub
mutation, or source-tree application." A GitHub mutation is the literal trigger.

## What P10 shipped, and what it deliberately did not

**Shipped:** `execute_write()` is implemented for `pr_create` (always
`--draft`), and `RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch()` can push one `claude/`
branch to origin. Both are fully tested, including against a real local git
remote.

**Deliberately not shipped:** the flag flip. P10 implemented the capability and
left it disarmed, because arming it is the step this repo reserves for a human
with a filed checklist — not for the change that builds the machinery.

---

## The gate chain, in the order it is evaluated

A write requires **all six** of these. Five are config or per-call; one is code.

| # | Gate | Where | Ships as | Fails closed? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `agentic.enabled` (the layer's master switch) | `config.yaml` | `false` | yes |
| 1 | `EXECUTION_ENABLED` | `agentic/writer.py` | `False` | yes |
| 2 | `agentic.mode == "write"` | `config.yaml` | `"read"` | yes |
| 3 | `agentic.writes_enabled` | `config.yaml` | `false` | yes |
| 4 | a non-empty human `reason` | per call | — | yes |
| 5 | `confirm is True` | per call | — | yes |

Gate 0 was, until an external review of this document's own claim caught it,
enforced only by the CLI's own `_disabled_noop()` short-circuit — the prose
here said "the CLI no-ops entirely," which was true for the CLI but silently
NOT true for a direct call into `plan_write()`/`execute_write()`, a
programmatic boundary the CLI does not gate on anyone's behalf. It is now
enforced inside `_require_gates()` itself, ahead of gates 2–5, so it holds
regardless of caller.

`plan_write()` runs gates 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 (everything but the code-level
`EXECUTION_ENABLED`, which only `execute_write()` checks, first, before even
looking at the plan). `execute_write()` runs all six, including a FRESH
`confirm` its own caller must supply -- `plan_write()`'s `confirm` does not
carry forward via the plan dict, deliberately: a boolean baked into
hand-buildable, JSON round-trippable data would be exactly as forgeable as
manufacturing it internally, which is what an earlier version of this function
did. That matters: before P10 the numbered gates lived only in the planner, so
once the flag flipped, *holding a plan dict* would have become the authority to
write. A plan is data — hand-buildable, JSON round-trippable, able to cross a
process boundary. It is no longer authority.

---

## Enablement procedure

Do these in order. Each step is verifiable, and every step before the last is
reversible by editing one line back.

1. **Confirm `gh` is authenticated as the identity you intend.**
   `gh auth status`. The write path passes no credential of its own — it
   inherits whatever `gh` resolves. Whoever `gh` says you are is who opens the
   PR.
2. **Confirm push credentials exist for `git`, separately.** `push_branch()`
   runs under a four-name environment allowlist that deliberately excludes
   `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`, so it authenticates only via a HOME-resident
   credential helper. `gh auth setup-git` configures one. **A token-only
   environment with no helper will fail** — that is expected, not a bug. It is
   not widened, because that environment is shared with the executor that runs
   model-proposed check commands, and a GitHub token there is an exfiltration
   path.
3. **Dry-run first.** With gates 2–3 still closed, call `plan_write(...)` and
   read the `would_run` argv. Confirm `--draft` is present, `--repo` is your
   repo, and `--head` is the `claude/` branch you expect.
4. **File the checklist below.** Signed, dated, kept with the repo.
5. **Open the config gates** (`agentic.enabled: true` is presumably already on
   if you got this far; `mode: "write"`, `writes_enabled: true`). Still nothing
   executes — gate 1 (`EXECUTION_ENABLED`) is code, not config.
6. **Flip `EXECUTION_ENABLED` to `True`.** This is the last step and the only
   irreversible-in-effect one.
7. **Rehearse the rollback before you rely on it:** set it back to `False` and
   confirm `execute_write` refuses with `failed_gate: "execution_enabled"`.

## Security review checklist

*Flipping the write flag without a completed, filed copy of this checklist is
an unauthorized change.*

- [x] **A. Reachability — CHANGED 2026-07-31, decided 2026-08-01: sign off as-is.**
      This item previously read "No `/ops/*` endpoint, no harness route, and no
      CLI subcommand reaches `execute_write`," and said that if that ever
      changed the checklist was void and had to be re-run. **It changed.** That
      clause did its job: this is the re-run, and the item below is what it is
      now, not what anyone wishes it still were.

      `execute_write` is reachable from three places today:

      | Caller | Path | Additional gates on that path |
      |---|---|---|
      | CLI | `real-repo-run-decide --push --publish` | `--decision approve`, `--reason`, `--confirm-publish` |
      | CLI | `real-repo-run-publish` | run must be `approved` AND `pushed`, `--reason`, `--confirm` |
      | HTTP | `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/publish` | same run-state gates, plus `CYCLAW_API_KEY` + `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` |

      **A GitHub mutation is therefore network-triggerable once the flag is
      flipped** — by an authenticated, same-origin caller on loopback, against
      a run that already reached `approved` and `pushed`. That is a real
      widening of this document's original premise and the single most
      important thing to weigh before signing. It is not hidden by a config
      default: the HTTP route exists and is reachable *now*; only
      `EXECUTION_ENABLED` stops the write.

      What has NOT changed: `utils/ops_runner.py` still forwards no raw argv,
      the harness still sends check-profile NAMES against a fixed allow-list,
      and every gate in the chain above still applies per call. The exposure is
      "an authenticated local operator can trigger it from the console instead
      of only from a terminal," not "an unauthenticated caller can."

      Sign this item only if you accept that. If you want the flag armed for
      CLI use but NOT reachable over HTTP, the narrow change is to drop
      `real-repo-run-publish` from `_AGENTIC_ACTIONS` in `utils/ops_runner.py`
      and delete the `/publish` route — push and every other agent route are
      unaffected.

      **Decided 2026-08-01: accept HTTP reachability as-is.** The operator
      weighed the residual risks (single-tier credential shared with chat; a
      replayable JSON `confirm: true` in place of terminal keypress friction;
      `_enforce_same_origin` as a single point of failure for the whole
      cross-site exposure; no CLI-vs-HTTP channel attribution in the audit
      trail; `/publish` sharing chat's rate-limit bucket rather than a
      stricter one) and chose to sign off without further code changes. Those
      risks are recorded here, not resolved by code — re-read them before any
      future re-run of this checklist.
- [ ] **B. Draft-only.** `_build_write_argv`'s `pr_create` branch still ends in
      `--draft`, and `tests/test_agentic_writer.py` still asserts the argv as an
      exact list. That assertion is the only thing pinning draft-ness.
- [ ] **C. Head branch is explicit.** `--head` is required and constrained to
      `claude/*`. Without it `gh` infers the head from the process's working
      directory, which on the ops_runner path is the operator's own checkout.
- [ ] **D. Repo targeting.** `execute_write` refuses a plan whose `repo` differs
      from the configured one. The config is authoritative; the plan is advisory.
- [ ] **E. Plan integrity.** `execute_write` rebuilds the argv from the plan's
      own `params` and refuses on mismatch with `would_run`. It never executes
      the list it was handed.
- [ ] **F. No retry.** A write is attempted exactly once. A timeout is reported
      as INDETERMINATE rather than retried, because both of `run_read`'s retry
      branches fire after the request has already left the machine and could
      duplicate an accepted mutation.
- [ ] **G. Push scoping.** `push_branch` rejects every branch outside
      `claude/*`, enforced by test rather than convention — nothing else in the
      repo statically prevents a push elsewhere.
- [x] **H. Known gap, decided 2026-08-01: accepted.** `agentic/executor`'s verification
      checks run operator-supplied argv with cwd pinned to the clone. A
      checks-file entry of `{"argv": ["git", "push", ...]}` bypasses the
      `claude/*` scoping and the `allow_git_write_tools` gate entirely. The
      argv are operator-supplied, but that is not the mitigation it first
      appears to be: the *code that argv executes* runs against a worktree
      containing model-authored writes, so `{"argv": ["pytest"]}` — the
      shipped default profile — already executes model-authored content via
      normal test collection. The actual mitigation is narrower: the
      checks-file itself is local-only and operator-authored (no `/ops/*`
      route or harness API accepts raw argv; the harness sends check-profile
      **names** against a fixed allow-list — see
      `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`'s outbound/execution-surface sections). Decide
      explicitly: accept that scope, or close before enabling.

      **Decided 2026-08-01: accept the scope.** Worth restating why this gap
      sharpens once item A is armed, so a future re-read has the full picture:
      `agentic/executor/runner.py`'s env allowlist and
      `RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch()`'s both include `HOME`. Item A's own
      enablement step 2 requires a `HOME`-resident git credential helper for
      `push_branch()` to authenticate at all — the same helper is then
      equally reachable from a checks-file entry invoking `git`, with none of
      `push_branch()`'s own safeguards (`claude/*`-only branch regex, no
      `--force`). Before item A is armed this gap has no ambient credential to
      use; after, it is a second, unguarded path to the same authenticated
      push. The scope was accepted anyway, consistent with the single-operator
      threat model, but a future closure — if ever revisited — would override
      the git credential helper specifically inside the executor's subprocess
      environment (e.g. `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY0=credential.helper`/
      `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE0=""`), leaving `push_branch()`'s own credential path
      untouched, rather than an argv denylist (bypassable by a wrapper script
      or differently-named binary, and out of scope for a module whose
      containment model already assumes operator-authored local execution).
- [ ] **I. Blast radius understood.** With the flag on and gates 2–3 open, this
      code can push a `claude/*` branch and open a draft PR against the
      configured repo, as the authenticated `gh` identity. It cannot push to
      `main`, cannot force-push, and cannot delete anything.

      **Amended 2026-07-31 alongside item A:** the trigger surface is now wider
      than "a terminal." An authenticated same-origin request to
      `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/publish` reaches the same write. The blast
      radius per invocation is unchanged (one draft PR, one `claude/*` branch);
      what changed is who can invoke it and from where. Rate-limiting applies
      to the route, but a rate limit bounds frequency, not authority.
- [ ] **J. Master switch enforced in code, not just the CLI.**
      `_require_gates()` checks `agentic.enabled` first, ahead of every other
      gate. A direct call into `plan_write()`/`execute_write()` — bypassing the
      CLI's own `_disabled_noop()` — cannot skip it. (This was NOT true before
      an external review caught the gap; see the gate-chain section above.)
- [ ] **K. Confirm is never inherited from a plan.** `execute_write()` requires
      its own caller to supply a fresh `confirm=True`; it neither reads a
      `confirm` field off the plan (none exists) nor manufactures one
      internally. (Also not true before the same review.)

### Verification record — 2026-07-31 (agent-performed, not a sign-off)

Every item above was re-checked against the code as it stands at this date,
because item A's own void-and-re-run clause had fired. Method and result:

| Item | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A | `grep` for `execute_write` callers across `agentic/`, `utils/`, `harness/` | **Changed** — three callers, tabulated above |
| B | Read `_build_write_argv`; confirmed `tests/test_agentic_writer.py` still asserts the argv as an exact list ending `--draft` | Holds |
| C | Read `_require_head_branch` / `_HEAD_BRANCH_RE` | Holds — required, `claude/*`-anchored |
| D | Located the `plan.get("repo") != cfg.repo` refusal in `execute_write` | Holds |
| E | Located the rebuild + `declared[1:] != argv[1:]` mismatch refusal | Holds |
| F | Located the timeout → INDETERMINATE path; no retry branch | Holds |
| G | `tests/test_agentic_repo_workspace.py` parametrizes `main`, `feature/x`, `--force`, `claude/has space`, `""`, `HEAD` | Holds |
| H | Confirmed no `/ops/*` or harness route accepts raw argv (`checks: list[str]` of profile names → `resolve_check_profiles`) | Holds; **decided 2026-08-01 — accepted** |
| I | Re-derived from A | **Amended** above |
| J | Confirmed `_require_gates` checks `agentic.enabled` first | Holds |
| K | Confirmed `execute_write(confirm=...)` is keyword-required and `plan_write` stores no `confirm` key | Holds |

Runtime state at verification: `EXECUTION_ENABLED is False`,
`_EXECUTABLE_WRITE_OPS == {"pr_create"}`.

Steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the enablement procedure are **not** performed
here and cannot be: steps 1–2 read the operator's own `gh`/git credential
state on their machine, and steps 5–7 are the arming itself. This record
covers step 4's evidence only. Both decisions that were open are now
recorded: item A (sign off as-is, decided 2026-08-01) and item H (accept the
scope, decided 2026-08-01). Recording those decisions is not the same act as
signing this checklist — the sign-off line below, and the arming itself
(steps 5–7), remain the operator's own, separate, explicit action.

**Sign-off:** ______________________  **Date:** ____________

*(no sign-off, no flag flip — this verification record is evidence for a
signature, never a substitute for one)*

## What this does not change

`pr_comment` and `issue_comment` remain plan-only — describable, not
executable, refused by name at the execution boundary. The deepagent tool
surface still hard-refuses GitHub writes independently
(`deepagent_github/permissions.py`). `config.yaml`'s
`deepagent_github.allow_github_writes` remains `false` and remains a separate
question from this one.
