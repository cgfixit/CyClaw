# GitHub Write Enablement — procedure and security review

> **Status update — 2026-09-06 (docs review, Claude Code):** COMPLETE (as a procedure/checklist doc — meaning the enablement it describes is done and signed, not that writes are unrestricted). Verified against live code: `agentic/writer.py` has `EXECUTION_ENABLED = True` and the disable-only `CYCLAW_AGENTIC_WRITE_DISABLE` env kill switch (`_WRITE_DISABLE_ENV`); `config.yaml` ships `agentic.mode: "write"` / `agentic.writes_enabled: true` but `agentic.enabled: false` (line ~799) and both `deepagent_github.allow_github_writes: false` / `allow_git_write_tools: false` (lines 844, 853) — exactly the layered posture this doc's gate-chain table describes. This doc is self-maintaining (it already tracks its own checklist re-runs and the 2026-08-07 sign-off inline), so nothing here is stale relative to code.
>
> **What's left:**
> - Nothing outstanding — this is a living operational record, current as of its last internal edit. Keep updating it in place (not this stamp) if any of the six gates change state; do not archive it while `agentic.enabled` could still flip to `true`.

**Status: ARMED (operator-signed 2026-08-07).** `agentic/writer.py` ships
`EXECUTION_ENABLED = True`, and `config.yaml` ships `mode: write` +
`writes_enabled: true`. The layer master switch (`agentic.enabled`) still ships
`false`, so the CLI no-ops until an operator enables it. Per-call `reason` +
`confirm` remain mandatory. This document remains the procedure and rollback
checklist.

> **Checklist re-run in progress (2026-07-31), decisions recorded
> (2026-08-01).** Item A's void-and-re-run clause fired: `execute_write` is
> now reachable from two CLI subcommands and one authenticated HTTP route,
> which it was not when this document was written. Items A and I were
> rewritten accordingly and a dated verification record sits below the
> checklist. The operator has since decided both open items:
>
> - **Item A — sign off as-is.** HTTP reachability is accepted; the shipped
>   mitigations (the six-gate chain, rate limiting ahead of auth, the
>   Origin/Sec-Fetch-Site cross-site guard) are the accepted posture. No
>   further code change (no separate publish-tier credential, no added
>   confirmation factor) is required before signing.
> - **Item H — accept the scope.** The executor-argv gap stays a documented,
>   accepted risk, consistent with the single-operator threat model. No
>   targeted fix (e.g. overriding the executor's git credential helper) is
>   required before signing.
>
> **Signed and armed 2026-08-07 (CG).** Checklist items A/H remain accepted as
> recorded. Remaining live gates: `agentic.enabled` (still false by default),
> per-call reason + confirm, and the deepagent tooling flags
> (`allow_git_write_tools` / `allow_github_writes` still false).

It is the GitHub analogue of `FSCONNECT_WRITE_ENABLEMENT_PLAYBOOK.md` +
`FSCONNECT_SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`, and exists for the same reason: the
code half of an enablement is reviewable in a diff, and the operational half is
not. `DEEP_AGENT_HARNESS_PHASES_6_9.md` independently requires "a separate
human security review for any request to add shell, host filesystem, GitHub
mutation, or source-tree application." A GitHub mutation is the literal trigger.

## What P10 shipped, and what it deliberately did not

**Shipped:** `execute_write()` is implemented for `pr_create` (always
`--draft`), and `RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch()` can push one `claude/`
branch to origin. Both are fully tested, including against a real local git
remote.

**Later armed (2026-08-07):** the flag flip and config write gates. P10 built the
machinery disarmed; the operator checklist was signed and gates 1–3 were opened.
Gate 0 (`agentic.enabled`) remains the opt-in that actually turns the CLI on.

---

## The gate chain, in the order it is evaluated

A write requires **all six** of these. Five are config or per-call; one is code.

| # | Gate | Where | Ships as | Fails closed? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `agentic.enabled` (the layer's master switch) | `config.yaml` | `false` | yes |
| 1 | `EXECUTION_ENABLED` | `agentic/writer.py` | `True` (armed) | yes (if set False) |
| 2 | `agentic.mode == "write"` | `config.yaml` | `"write"` | yes |
| 3 | `agentic.writes_enabled` | `config.yaml` | `true` | yes |
| 4 | a non-empty human `reason` | per call | — | yes |
| 5 | `confirm is True` | per call | — | yes |

Gate 0 was, until an external review of this document's own claim caught it,
enforced only by the CLI's own `_disabled_noop()` short-circuit — the prose
here said "the CLI no-ops entirely," which was true for the CLI but silently
NOT true for a direct call into `plan_write()`/`execute_write()`, a
programmatic boundary the CLI does not gate on anyone's behalf. It is now
enforced inside `_require_gates()` itself, ahead of gates 2–5, so it holds
regardless of caller.

`plan_write()` runs gates 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 (everything but the code-level
`EXECUTION_ENABLED`, which only `execute_write()` checks, first, before even
looking at the plan). `execute_write()` runs all six, including a FRESH
`confirm` its own caller must supply -- `plan_write()`'s `confirm` does not
carry forward via the plan dict, deliberately: a boolean baked into
hand-buildable, JSON round-trippable data would be exactly as forgeable as
manufacturing it internally, which is what an earlier version of this function
did. That matters: before P10 the numbered gates lived only in the planner, so
once the flag flipped, *holding a plan dict* would have become the authority to
write. A plan is data — hand-buildable, JSON round-trippable, able to cross a
process boundary. It is no longer authority.

---

## Enablement procedure

Do these in order. Each step is verifiable, and every step before the last is
reversible by editing one line back.

1. **Confirm `gh` is authenticated as the identity you intend.**
   `gh auth status`. The write path passes no credential of its own — it
   inherits whatever `gh` resolves. Whoever `gh` says you are is who opens the
   PR.
2. **Confirm push credentials exist for `git`, separately.** `push_branch()`
   runs under a four-name environment allowlist that deliberately excludes
   `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`, so it authenticates only via a HOME-resident
   credential helper. `gh auth setup-git` configures one. **A token-only
   environment with no helper will fail** — that is expected, not a bug. It is
   not widened, because that environment is shared with the executor that runs
   model-proposed check commands, and a GitHub token there is an exfiltration
   path.
3. **Dry-run first.** With gates 2–3 still closed, call `plan_write(...)` and
   read the `would_run` argv. Confirm `--draft` is present, `--repo` is your
   repo, and `--head` is the `claude/` branch you expect.
4. **File the checklist below.** Signed, dated, kept with the repo.
5. **Open the config gates** (`agentic.enabled: true` is presumably already on
   if you got this far; `mode: "write"`, `writes_enabled: true`). Still nothing
   executes — gate 1 (`EXECUTION_ENABLED`) is code, not config.
6. **Flip `EXECUTION_ENABLED` to `True`.** This is the last step and the only
   irreversible-in-effect one.
7. **Rehearse the rollback before you rely on it:** set it back to `False` and
   confirm `execute_write` refuses with `failed_gate: "execution_enabled"`.

## Rollback without a source edit

Now that `EXECUTION_ENABLED` ships `True`, editing it back to `False` also means
editing the tests that pin the armed posture — which puts a safety action in
tension with the "never weaken a test" rule. Exporting the kill switch avoids
that entirely:

```bash
export CYCLAW_AGENTIC_WRITE_DISABLE=1     # 1 / true / yes / on
```

`execute_write` then refuses with `failed_gate: "execution_enabled"` and a
message naming the env var, and the refusal is audited as
`agentic_write_execution_blocked` exactly as the flag rollback is.

It is **disable-only**: `agentic/writer.py` AND-s it with `EXECUTION_ENABLED`
rather than OR-ing, so it can close the gate but never open one that ships
closed. That asymmetry is what makes reading this from the environment safe —
an accidental or hostile env var cannot arm a disarmed build.

It is read **once at import**, so a long-running harness process picks it up on
restart; a per-call re-read would let the gate flip underneath an in-flight
write. For a permanent rollback, still edit the flag (and its tests) — the env
var is the fast, no-diff path, not a replacement for the decision.

---

## Security review checklist

*Flipping the write flag without a completed, filed copy of this checklist is
an unauthorized change.*

- [x] **A. Reachability — CHANGED 2026-07-31, decided 2026-08-01: sign off as-is.**
      This item previously read "No `/ops/*` endpoint, no harness route, and no
      CLI subcommand reaches `execute_write`," and said that if that ever
      changed the checklist was void and had to be re-run. **It changed.** That
      clause did its job: this is the re-run, and the item below is what it is
      now, not what anyone wishes it still were.

      `execute_write` is reachable from three places today:

      | Caller | Path | Additional gates on that path |
      |---|---|---|
      | CLI | `real-repo-run-decide --push --publish` | `--decision approve`, `--reason`, `--confirm-publish` |
      | CLI | `real-repo-run-publish` | run must be `approved` AND `pushed`, `--reason`, `--confirm` |
      | ~~HTTP~~ | ~~`POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/publish`~~ | **Removed 2026-09-11 (PR #1367)** with the Python coding-harness console; `POST /ops/agentic` does not accept `real-repo-run*`, so no HTTP route reaches `execute_write` today |

      **A GitHub mutation is therefore network-triggerable once the flag is
      flipped** — by an authenticated, same-origin caller on loopback, against
      a run that already reached `approved` and `pushed`. That is a real
      widening of this document's original premise and the single most
      important thing to weigh before signing. It is not hidden by a config
      default: the HTTP route exists and is reachable *now*; only
      `EXECUTION_ENABLED` stops the write.

      What has NOT changed: `utils/ops_runner.py` still forwards no raw argv,
      the harness still sends check-profile NAMES against a fixed allow-list,
      and every gate in the chain above still applies per call. The exposure is
      "an authenticated local operator can trigger it from the console instead
      of only from a terminal," not "an unauthenticated caller can."

      Sign this item only if you accept that. If you want the flag armed for
      CLI use but NOT reachable over HTTP, the narrow change is to drop
      `real-repo-run-publish` from `_AGENTIC_ACTIONS` in `utils/ops_runner.py`
      and delete the `/publish` route — push and every other agent route are
      unaffected.

      **Decided 2026-08-01: accept HTTP reachability as-is.** The operator
      weighed the residual risks (single-tier credential shared with chat; a
      replayable JSON `confirm: true` in place of terminal keypress friction;
      `_enforce_same_origin` as a single point of failure for the whole
      cross-site exposure; no CLI-vs-HTTP channel attribution in the audit
      trail; `/publish` sharing chat's rate-limit bucket rather than a
      stricter one) and chose to sign off without further code changes. Those
      risks are recorded here, not resolved by code — re-read them before any
      future re-run of this checklist.

      **Amended 2026-08-01, same day: one of those risks got a targeted fix
      after all.** `_enforce_same_origin` being "a single point of failure"
      specifically meant a local process holding `CYCLAW_API_KEY` but sending
      neither `Origin` nor `Sec-Fetch-Site` sailed past that check by design
      (it exists to stop *browsers*, and deliberately allows header-less
      callers). `harness/server.py` now also requires a per-process CSRF
      token, minted at server start and handed out nowhere except embedded in
      the page `GET /` serves, checked unconditionally (no header-less
      carve-out) as an additional condition in the `guarded` dependency chain.
      A caller with the API key but who never fetched the console page still
      cannot reach `/publish` or any other guarded route. The other four
      accepted risks in the paragraph above (single-tier credential,
      replayable `confirm`, no channel attribution, shared rate-limit bucket)
      remain accepted as-is — this fix is scoped to the one gap named above,
      not a general re-opening of the checklist.
- [x] **B. Draft-only.** `_build_write_argv`'s `pr_create` branch still ends in
      `--draft`, and `tests/test_agentic_writer.py` still asserts the argv as an
      exact list. That assertion is the only thing pinning draft-ness.
- [x] **C. Head branch is explicit.** `--head` is required and constrained to
      `claude/*`. Without it `gh` infers the head from the process's working
      directory, which on the ops_runner path is the operator's own checkout.
- [x] **D. Repo targeting.** `execute_write` refuses a plan whose `repo` differs
      from the configured one. The config is authoritative; the plan is advisory.
- [x] **E. Plan integrity.** `execute_write` rebuilds the argv from the plan's
      own `params` and refuses on mismatch with `would_run`. It never executes
      the list it was handed.
- [x] **F. No retry.** A write is attempted exactly once. A timeout is reported
      as INDETERMINATE rather than retried, because both of `run_read`'s retry
      branches fire after the request has already left the machine and could
      duplicate an accepted mutation.
- [x] **G. Push scoping.** `push_branch` rejects every branch outside
      `claude/*`, enforced by test rather than convention — nothing else in the
      repo statically prevents a push elsewhere.
- [x] **H. Known gap, decided 2026-08-01: accepted.** `agentic/executor`'s verification
      checks run operator-supplied argv with cwd pinned to the clone. A
      checks-file entry of `{"argv": ["git", "push", ...]}` bypasses the
      `claude/*` scoping and the `allow_git_write_tools` gate entirely. The
      argv are operator-supplied, but that is not the mitigation it first
      appears to be: the *code that argv executes* runs against a worktree
      containing model-authored writes, so `{"argv": ["pytest"]}` — the
      shipped default profile — already executes model-authored content via
      normal test collection. The actual mitigation is narrower: the
      checks-file itself is local-only and operator-authored (no `/ops/*`
      route or harness API accepts raw argv; the harness sends check-profile
      **names** against a fixed allow-list — see
      `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`'s outbound/execution-surface sections). Decide
      explicitly: accept that scope, or close before enabling.

      **Decided 2026-08-01: accept the scope.** Worth restating why this gap
      sharpens once item A is armed, so a future re-read has the full picture:
      `agentic/executor/runner.py`'s env allowlist and
      `RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch()`'s both include `HOME`. Item A's own
      enablement step 2 requires a `HOME`-resident git credential helper for
      `push_branch()` to authenticate at all — the same helper is then
      equally reachable from a checks-file entry invoking `git`, with none of
      `push_branch()`'s own safeguards (`claude/*`-only branch regex, no
      `--force`). Before item A is armed this gap has no ambient credential to
      use; after, it is a second, unguarded path to the same authenticated
      push. The scope was accepted anyway, consistent with the single-operator
      threat model, but a future closure — if ever revisited — would override
      the git credential helper specifically inside the executor's subprocess
      environment (e.g. `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY0=credential.helper`/
      `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE0=""`), leaving `push_branch()`'s own credential path
      untouched, rather than an argv denylist (bypassable by a wrapper script
      or differently-named binary, and out of scope for a module whose
      containment model already assumes operator-authored local execution).
- [x] **I. Blast radius understood.** With the flag on and gates 2–3 open, this
      code can push a `claude/*` branch and open a draft PR against the
      configured repo, as the authenticated `gh` identity. It cannot push to
      `main`, cannot force-push, and cannot delete anything.

      **Amended 2026-09-11 (PR #1367):** the HTTP trigger below is gone with the
      console; the surface is a terminal again. The 2026-07-31 text is kept as
      the dated record.

      **Amended 2026-07-31 alongside item A:** the trigger surface is now wider
      than "a terminal." An authenticated same-origin request to
      `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/publish` reaches the same write. The blast
      radius per invocation is unchanged (one draft PR, one `claude/*` branch);
      what changed is who can invoke it and from where. Rate-limiting applies
      to the route, but a rate limit bounds frequency, not authority.
- [x] **J. Master switch enforced in code, not just the CLI.**
      `_require_gates()` checks `agentic.enabled` first, ahead of every other
      gate. A direct call into `plan_write()`/`execute_write()` — bypassing the
      CLI's own `_disabled_noop()` — cannot skip it. (This was NOT true before
      an external review caught the gap; see the gate-chain section above.)
- [x] **K. Confirm is never inherited from a plan.** `execute_write()` requires
      its own caller to supply a fresh `confirm=True`; it neither reads a
      `confirm` field off the plan (none exists) nor manufactures one
      internally. (Also not true before the same review.)

### Verification record — 2026-07-31 (agent-performed, not a sign-off)
Note for agents: ^ Re-check this (if needed or potentially helpful) after human verification and sign off and Write enabled in config on 8.7.2-2026 if needed next explicit request or /doc-sync run

Method and 7.31.2026 result:

| Item | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A | `grep` for `execute_write` callers across `agentic/`, `utils/`, `harness/` | **Changed** — three callers, tabulated above |
| B | Read `_build_write_argv`; confirmed `tests/test_agentic_writer.py` still asserts the argv as an exact list ending `--draft` | Holds |
| C | Read `_require_head_branch` / `_HEAD_BRANCH_RE` | Holds — required, `claude/*`-anchored |
| D | Located the `plan.get("repo") != cfg.repo` refusal in `execute_write` | Holds |
| E | Located the rebuild + `declared[1:] != argv[1:]` mismatch refusal | Holds |
| F | Located the timeout → INDETERMINATE path; no retry branch | Holds |
| G | `tests/test_agentic_repo_workspace.py` parametrizes `main`, `feature/x`, `--force`, `claude/has space`, `""`, `HEAD` | Holds |
| H | Confirmed no `/ops/*` or harness route accepts raw argv (`checks: list[str]` of profile names → `resolve_check_profiles`) | Holds; **decided 2026-08-01 — accepted** |
| I | Re-derived from A | **Amended** above |
| J | Confirmed `_require_gates` checks `agentic.enabled` first | Holds |
| K | Confirmed `execute_write(confirm=...)` is keyword-required and `plan_write` stores no `confirm` key | Holds |

Runtime state at verification (pre-arm 2026-07-31): `EXECUTION_ENABLED is False`,
`_EXECUTABLE_WRITE_OPS == {"pr_create"}`. Post-arm (2026-08-07): `EXECUTION_ENABLED is True`;
executable ops unchanged.

Steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the enablement procedure are **not** performed
here and cannot be: steps 1–2 read the operator's own `gh`/git credential
state on their machine, and steps 5–7 are the arming itself. This record
covers step 4's evidence only. Both decisions that were open are now
recorded: item A (sign off as-is, decided 2026-08-01) and item H (accept the
scope, decided 2026-08-01). Recording those decisions is not the same act as
signing this checklist — the sign-off line below, and the arming itself
(steps 5–7), remain the operator's own, separate, explicit action.

**Sign-off:** CG  **Date:** 8.7.2026

Armed the same day: `EXECUTION_ENABLED=True`, `mode: write`, `writes_enabled: true`,
cloud providers gated open (`allow_cloud_providers: true` + provider enables).
`agentic.enabled` remains false until the operator turns the layer on.

---

## What this does not change

`pr_comment` and `issue_comment` remain plan-only — describable, not
executable, refused by name at the execution boundary. The deepagent tool
surface still hard-refuses GitHub writes independently
(`deepagent_github/permissions.py`). `config.yaml`'s
`deepagent_github.allow_github_writes` remains `false` and remains a separate
question from this one.
