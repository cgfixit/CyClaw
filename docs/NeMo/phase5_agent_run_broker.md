# NeMo Phase 5 — wrap `POST /api/agent/run` through ToolBroker

> **Status update — 2026-09-11 (doc-sync, PR #1367):** HISTORICAL. The Python coding-harness console (`harness/`, `static/harness.html`, `:8790`, every `/api/*` route named below) was removed from CyClaw; the coding console now lives in the sibling Rust project CG-agent-harness. Nothing below is a live claim.

> **Status update — 2026-09-06 (docs review, Claude Code):** COMPLETE.
> Verified live: `harness/server.py:92` imports `from utils.tool_broker import
> ToolDenied, assert_allowed`, and `assert_allowed(...)` is called at line
> 1368 in the `agent_run` handler, matching this doc's Decision 2 call-site
> contract exactly.
>
> **What's left:**
> - Nothing outstanding — fully implemented; see `harness/server.py:92,1368`
>   and `tests/test_tool_broker_adversarial.py`. This doc is a historical
>   decision log. **KEEP** (re-verified 2026-09-06): its only inbound link is
>   `docs/NeMo/README.md:132`, which intentionally indexes it under
>   "Historical plans" with its siblings. It is the cheapest of that set to
>   remove if the owner wants to — the one edit needed is dropping that row.

**Status (2026-08-27):** **SHIPPED** on `main` as [#1163](https://github.com/cgfixit/CyClaw/pull/1163).
This file is the decision log. Do not treat the body as a to-do.

Audience: anyone changing `harness/server.py` `agent_run` — keep the wrap
(`utils.tool_broker.assert_allowed("agent_run", ("real-repo-run",))` after
profile resolve, before `_agentic_call`).

## Wrong target

Issue remaining text said “harness `/loop` + agentic proposer under the same
ToolBroker.” The proposer is **not a tool path**.

`agentic/harness_optimizer/proposer.py` `build_proposer_workspace` creates
local artifact directories only. Its module docstring states it does not
expose file tools, run commands, call models, or apply proposals. Wrapping
that function as `proposer_workspace` would be a name-gate on `mkdir`.

NVIDIA ToolRailAction / IORails tool rails validate `ToolCall` / `ToolResult`.
They do not apply to workspace builders or to `/loop` chat. Do not enable
IORails as the production engine to “cover” this route.

---

## Right target

`POST /api/agent/run` in `harness/server.py` (`agent_run`).

Live chain today:

1. FastAPI `dependencies=guarded` (API key + CSRF).
2. `resolve_check_profiles(req.checks)` — profile **names**, never argv.
3. `_agentic_call("real-repo-run", lambda: run_agentic_op("real-repo-run", ...))`.
4. `utils.ops_runner` subprocess into `agentic.cli` (argv list, not `shell=True`).

`AgentRunRequest` already requires `instruction`, `reason`, `confirm`
(default **false**). Omitting confirm hits the CLI refusal (exit 4). The
broker is a **name-gate in front of that subprocess**, not a replacement
for confirm/reason.

---

## Decisions a future PR must satisfy

### 1 — Import `utils.tool_broker`, never `guardrails`

After #1157, canonical code is `utils/tool_broker.py`. Harness must not
import the `guardrails` package (I6 sibling-OOB AST guard). Use:

```python
from utils.tool_broker import ToolDenied, assert_allowed
```

`guardrails.tool_broker` remains a re-export for guardrails-side tests only.

### 2 — Call site

After `resolve_check_profiles` succeeds, **before** `_agentic_call`:

```python
assert_allowed(
    "agent_run",
    ("real-repo-run",),
    allowlist=frozenset({"agent_run"}),
)
```

On `ToolDenied`: HTTP 403, code `TOOL_DENIED`. `run_agentic_op` must not
run (spy in the test). Empty-allowlist monkeypatch is the deny path; the
production allowlist on this route is `{agent_run}`.

Ordinary `POST /api/chat` (`loop=false`) does not call `decide`.

### 3 — Argv is the op name, not the instruction

Argv is exactly `("real-repo-run",)`.

**Forbidden in argv and in the audit event:** `instruction`, `reason`,
`commit_message`, `branch`, `read_files`, URLs, file paths. Audit already
stores name + argv digest only; do not add free-text fields.

### 4 — Existing gates stay

Do not delete or bypass: API key, CSRF, `confirm` default false, non-empty
`reason`, check-profile allowlist, ops_runner argv list. ToolBroker cannot
grant a run when confirm is missing.

### 5 — Out of scope for that PR

| Surface | Why later / never |
|---|---|
| `POST .../decision` / `push` / `publish` | Separate tool names (`agent_decide`, `agent_push`, `agent_publish`) on their own PRs |
| MCP `tools/call` | I6: `mcp_hybrid_server.py` must not import brokers |
| `build_proposer_workspace` | Not a tool |
| `guardrails.enabled = true` | Not planned by #1134 |
| IORails / `LLMRails.generate_async` on `/query` | Forbidden |
| 13th graph node | Forbidden |

### 6 — Topology

Stack on #1157 (`utils.tool_broker`) or on `main` after #1157 merges. Do not
edit `tests/test_tool_broker_adversarial.py` or this file except to mark the
contract shipped. Do not restack by rewriting #1158 in the same PR.

Files the wrap PR is expected to touch:

- `harness/server.py` (one call site)
- `tests/test_harness_agent_routes.py` (or a small new test module)
- not `docs/NeMo/README.md` (owned by other open drafts)

---

## Verify the wrap PR must run

```
GROK_API_KEY=dummy python -m pytest tests/test_harness_agent_routes.py tests/test_tool_broker_adversarial.py tests/test_harness_isolation.py -q --tb=short
ruff check --select E,F,I,B,C4,UP,S harness/server.py
```

Empty allowlist → 403 `TOOL_DENIED` and zero `run_agentic_op` calls. Happy
path still requires `confirm=true` + `reason`. soul.md unchanged.
`gate.py` / `graph.py` / `mcp_hybrid_server.py` untouched.
