# CyClaw Threat Model & Sandbox Scope

This document states plainly **what CyClaw's "sandbox" does and does not protect
against**, so the security posture is neither under-built nor over-sold. It
consolidates the threat-model assumptions previously scattered across
`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md`, `.github/SECURITY.md`,
`config.yaml`, and code comments.

> 💡 **One-line stance:** CyClaw is a **single-operator, loopback-bound, local
> RAG server**. Its layered controls are strong *for that deployment*. It is
> **not** a multi-tenant platform for executing untrusted code, and does not
> claim microVM/hypervisor-grade isolation.

---

## 1. System assumptions (the deployment we secure for)

| Assumption | Value |
|---|---|
| Network exposure | Host exposure is **exclusively** `127.0.0.1:8787` — never a non-loopback host interface. Bare-metal runs bind loopback directly; the container deployment publishes only to host loopback (`127.0.0.1:8787:8787`) while uvicorn binds the container-private network namespace (`0.0.0.0` inside the container) so the publish can reach it. |
| Operators | **Single trusted operator** (or a small trusted home-lab/LAN). |
| Tenancy | **Single-tenant.** No mutual isolation between users is attempted. |
| Data store | Embedded ChromaDB (`PersistentClient`) + local BM25 + SQLite. No HTTP DB. |
| LLM | Local Ollama over loopback; optional Grok and/or Claude fallback (triple-gated per provider). **Since 2026-08-07 the shipped `config.yaml` satisfies two of those three gates** — `app.mode: "hybrid"` and both `models.grok.enabled` / `models.claude.enabled` are `true`. The third, `user_confirmed_online`, is per-request and cannot be pre-set by config. See the eighth amendment in §5. |
| Outbound model egress | **Two planes. Neither is "off by default" any more — see the eighth amendment in §5.** Core plane: two of its three gates ship satisfied (`app.mode: "hybrid"`, both providers `enabled: true`); only the per-request `user_confirmed_online` still stands. Agentic plane: `allow_cloud_providers` and both `providers.<name>.enabled` ship `true`; `agentic.enabled`, `deepagent_github.enabled`, the API-key env var, and `--confirm-online` still stand. The core graph's triple-gated fallback (`mode==hybrid` AND `<provider>.enabled` AND `user_confirmed_online`), and the out-of-band Deep Agents harness behind a six-condition chain: `agentic.enabled`, `deepagent_github.enabled`, `allow_cloud_providers`, `providers.<name>.enabled`, the provider's API-key env var present, and a per-run `--confirm-online`. Destinations are `api.x.ai` and `api.anthropic.com` only. `agentic/deepagent_github/handoff.py` implements a `HandoffEnvelope`/`sanitize_handoff` to record egress this way — a SHA-256 of the outbound prompt, its length, the context doc ids, and a redaction count, never the prompt text. **This chain now has two consumers, not one, with different egress-recording states (see §5's fifth amendment):** `agentic/cli.py`'s `real-repo-run --provider`, wired to `agentic.deepagent_github.chat_client.ChatModelProposerClient`, calls `sanitize_handoff` on every real invocation — egress IS recorded there. The separate, still-unwired `builder.py`/DeepAgents-graph path (`deepagent-plan`, probe-only) passes its constructed cloud `BaseChatModel` straight to the DeepAgents `creator(model=model, ...)` call with no wrapping through `sanitize_handoff`; that path's egress is NOT recorded, and remains out-of-scope follow-on work. |
| Agentic / sync layers | **Out-of-band, opt-in, disabled by default.** Never imported by `gate.py`/`graph.py`/`mcp_hybrid_server.py`. |
| Host | A machine the operator controls. Host root is **trusted**. |

If you deploy outside these assumptions (internet-facing, multi-tenant, running
untrusted third-party skills), **re-evaluate** — several controls below are scoped
to the single-operator model and are not sufficient on their own for hostile
multi-tenant workloads.

---

## 2. In-scope adversaries & the control that answers each

| Threat | Primary control | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt injection** (direct) | 40-pattern sanitizer at `/query` and at index time | `utils/sanitizer.py`, `config.yaml` |
| **Indirect / RAG injection** (poisoned retrieved doc) | Retrieved context tagged untrusted in-prompt; topology never lets a doc redirect routing | `graph.py` (`UNTRUSTED_NOTE`, topology=policy) |
| **Corpus / memory poisoning** | Injection scan on ingestion; chunk sanitization | `retrieval/indexer.py`, `utils/sanitizer.py` |
| **Soul poisoning** (persisted identity hijack) | Soul writes require human `reason`; injection gate enforced at the write boundary; atomic `os.replace`; SHA-256 drift detection | `utils/personality.py`, `gate.py` |
| **Unauthorized soul mutation** | Fail-closed Bearer auth on all `/soul/*`; constant-time key compare | `gate.py` |
| **DNS-rebinding → state-changing POST** | `TrustedHostMiddleware` Host allow-list (outermost middleware) | `gate.py`, `config.yaml` |
| **Unauthorized cross-origin reads** | CORS allow-list | `gate.py`, `config.yaml` |
| **Uncontrolled external model calls** | Triple-gate: `mode=hybrid` **and** the selected provider's `grok.enabled`/`claude.enabled` **and** `user_confirmed_online` | `graph.py`, `config.yaml` |
| **Telemetry / data exfil via tracing** | Telemetry-kill env vars set before any import, by **every** entry point (gateway, MCP server, indexer CLI) from one shared mapping — an ambient value in the operator's environment is overwritten, not inherited; HF Hub network calls are additionally cut off via `local_files_only=True` once the embedding model is confirmed cached on disk (the `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`/`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` env vars alone do not gate this in-process — huggingface_hub latches that constant at its own import time, which the eligibility probe itself triggers before the env vars are set; `local_files_only` is passed directly to `SentenceTransformer(...)` instead, which gates independently); raw query text never persisted (hashes only) | `utils/telemetry_kill.py`, `gate.py`, `mcp_hybrid_server.py`, `retrieval/vector_store.py`, `retrieval/embeddings.py`, `utils/logger.py` |
| **DoS (request flood / runaway process)** | Per-IP rate limit (60/min); container `mem`/`pids`/`cpus` limits | `utils/ratelimit.py`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| **Compromised out-of-band subprocess** (rclone/gh) | argv-list only (no `shell=True`); absolute binary paths; Docker builtin seccomp; non-root; `no-new-privileges`; `cap_drop: ALL`; read-only rootfs | `sync/`, `agentic/`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `deploy/seccomp/` |

---

## 3. What the sandbox layers DO cover

Container/OS-level controls currently enforced (see `Dockerfile` +
`docker-compose.yml`):

- **Loopback-only** publish (`127.0.0.1:8787`).
- **Non-root** runtime user (`uid:gid 1000:1000`), multi-stage minimal image.
- **`no-new-privileges:true`** — no setuid privilege escalation in-container.
- **`cap_drop: ALL`** — zero Linux capabilities.
- **Read-only root filesystem** with explicit writable carve-outs
  (`data`/`index`/`logs`/`checkpoints`/`.emb_cache` + `tmpfs:/tmp`).
- **Docker's engine-maintained builtin seccomp profile** is explicitly selected
  even if the daemon default is customized or unconfined. It
  blocks `mount`, `ptrace`, `reboot`, `bpf`, `io_uring_*`, restricted socket
  families, and other high-risk calls. The former repository profiles were
  removed because they were untraced and could not plausibly boot the gate.
- **Resource ceilings** (`mem_limit`, `pids_limit`, `cpus`).
- **Optional eBPF detection** (Falco, `deploy/falco/`) — disabled by default;
  logs anomalous exec/write/egress on the agentic & sync paths.

Application/architectural controls (the primary boundary — enforced by graph
topology, not prompts): the **five security invariants** (RAG-first,
topology=policy, triple-gated external, audit convergence, soul governance) and
**module isolation** (out-of-band layers never imported by core paths). See
`CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md`.

---

## 4. What the sandbox layers DO **not** cover (explicit non-goals)

> ⚠️ Do not rely on CyClaw for any of the following without additional, external
> controls. These are out of scope **by design** for the single-operator model.

- **Untrusted multi-tenant code execution.** CyClaw is not a platform for running
  arbitrary user-supplied code. `agentic/executor/` (added after this document's
  original write-up; see §5's dated note) can run `pytest`/`ruff`/the invariant
  guard as subprocesses over a worktree — that is real code execution, and this
  bullet no longer claims the agentic layer executes nothing. What it still
  claims, and what remains true: this is not multi-tenant, and it is not a
  platform for arbitrary *third-party* code — see §5 for the distinction and its
  limits.
- **A hard network boundary around the verification executor.** `agentic/executor`'s
  environment scrub (dropping proxy variables and API keys, setting
  `PIP_NO_INDEX`) is a best-effort software control, not a network namespace or
  firewall. It stops the common case — an HTTP-library-based request, or an
  accidental secret-env leak into a check's output — and does **not** stop a
  direct ordinary TCP/UDP socket, which never consults `HTTPS_PROXY`. Treat any claim
  that a verified worktree "had no network access" as unverified until a real
  namespace/firewall control exists (§6, stage 5).
- **Kernel / hypervisor escape.** There is **no per-workload microVM**
  (gVisor/Firecracker). Container isolation shares the container host's Linux
  kernel. On Docker Desktop that kernel is in the managed Linux VM rather than
  macOS itself, but a container escape still compromises that VM; the desktop
  hypervisor is only the next boundary. This is acceptable only while the
  workload and host root remain trusted.
- **Hostile local root.** The host operator is trusted. CyClaw does not defend
  against a malicious root on the same machine.
- **Internet-facing / public multi-user deployment.** The loopback bind, CORS,
  and Host allow-list assume a trusted local caller. Exposing the port publicly
  voids the threat model.
- **Tight gate-specific syscall blocking.** Docker's builtin seccomp profile is
  enforced, but a trace-derived gate profile is not. It must be generated and
  replayed for the exact image on `arm64` and `amd64`; `/ops` children require
  a separate profile or a broader union policy (see §6).
- **Confidentiality against a compromised Ollama / Grok / Claude endpoint.** Prompt and
  retrieved context are sent to the configured model; trust in that endpoint is
  assumed.
- **Provider-side retention of anything sent to Grok or Claude.** Once bytes reach
  a provider, retention and processing are governed by that provider's agreement,
  not by CyClaw. This is why every egress path on the **answer** path ends in a
  per-use confirmation.

  Two qualifiers, both added 2026-08-07 after an audit found the older
  unqualified sentence ("every egress path ends in a per-use human
  confirmation") to be false as written:

  1. **`/health`'s provider-liveness probes are not on the answer path** and
     never consult `user_confirmed_online`. They are governed by
     `api.health_probe_external_providers` instead, which ships `false` — so a
     default checkout makes no such call — but when an operator opts in, that
     egress is triggered by an unauthenticated, unrate-limited route.
  2. **`user_confirmed_online` is a self-asserted request field**, not a
     server-enforced human act. `/query` is unauthenticated and the flag is a
     declared field on `QueryRequest`, so any local process can set it in a
     single POST. The confirmation pause is real in the graph
     (`user_gate_router`) and a genuine UX affordance in `terminal.html`, but
     it is a **client-side convention**, not a control that survives a hostile
     or automated local caller. Treat "a human confirmed this" as an assumption
     of the single-trusted-operator model, not as an enforced property.

---

## 5. Why microVM isolation is **not yet** required here

A 2026 review may call for gVisor/Firecracker around "agentic code that can
touch fs/sql." For the shipped CyClaw model that control remains conditional,
not because execution risk was removed, but because the operator, host, target
repository, and explicitly enabled workload are trusted and single-tenant:

- **GitHub writes are implemented and the code-level flag is armed** (amended by
  P10, then by the operator enablement of 2026-08-07 — see the fourth and
  eighth amendments in §5). `agentic/writer.py` ships `EXECUTION_ENABLED = True`
  and `agentic.mode`/`agentic.writes_enabled` ship open. What holds the line on
  a shipped checkout is now a **single** config gate — `agentic.enabled`, which
  ships `false` — plus the per-call `reason` and `confirm`, which are supplied
  by the same caller that requests the write. `execute_write()` re-runs the full
  gate on every call rather than trusting the plan it is handed, and
  `agentic.enabled` is checked first, ahead of everything else. A rollback that
  needs no source edit is available via `CYCLAW_AGENTIC_WRITE_DISABLE`.
- **SQL is read-only-guarded.** `agentic/sqlconnect/client.py` rejects every
  non-`SELECT` statement (and comments, and multi-statements) before execution.
  A *second*, distinct guard rejects side-effect **functions** by name
  (`pg_read_*`, `pg_ls_*`, `lo_export`, `dblink*`, `pg_sleep`, …). That one is
  explicitly defense-in-depth for an over-privileged DSN — the case a read-only
  connector exists to contain — and it was bypassable until 2026-08-08:
  PostgreSQL un-escapes a unicode-escaped identifier (`U&"pg_\0072ead_file"`)
  into the plain built-in *before* the grammar runs, while the name-scan saw the
  raw escaped text and matched nothing. Verified against a live PostgreSQL 16,
  including the schema-qualified form; `/etc/passwd` was read back through the
  guard. The `U&` prefix is now refused outright rather than decoded, matching
  the neighbouring `E'...'` rule — reimplementing Postgres's UIDENT rules
  (`\XXXX`, `\+XXXXXX`, surrogate pairs, a `UESCAPE` clause that redefines the
  escape character) would make any gap in that decoder a fresh bypass. The
  statement-keyword half above was never affected: those keywords cannot be
  spelled as quoted identifiers.
- **Filesystem writes are triple-gated and off by default.** `writes_enabled`
  defaults `False`; writes additionally require a non-empty `reason` and `confirm`,
  and are confined to an allow-list of writable roots via zero-TOCTOU path checks.
- **Local governed writes exist and are not the same thing as GitHub writes.**
  Two agentic write paths are shipped, working, and default-off:
  `agentic/fsconnect/writer.py` (the filesystem writer above, which carries its
  own `FS_WRITE_HARD_DISABLE` module constant alongside the config gates) and
  `agentic/harness_optimizer/patching.py::apply_candidate_artifact`, which
  writes a SHA-256-versioned JSON record under `data/agentic/harness_optimizer/`
  after eight sequential gates including an independent injection re-check. Read
  "GitHub writes are hard-killed" above as scoped to GitHub — not as "the
  agentic layer never writes anything."
- **The skills registry never auto-writes.** `propose_skill` is advisory-only;
  `apply_skill` enforces the injection gate + `reason` and writes atomically to a
  single confined JSON path. All registry operations (`propose-skill` /
  `apply-skill`) are additionally gated on the `agentic.enabled` master switch:
  when the layer is disabled they no-op, so a registry write can never occur while
  the operator believes the layer is off (including via the API-key-gated
  `POST /ops/agentic` console).
- **No `shell=True` anywhere.** Every subprocess uses argv-list form with an
  absolute/fixed binary path.
- **Core paths exec nothing.** `gate.py`/`graph.py`/`mcp_hybrid_server.py` spawn
  no subprocesses and never import the agentic/sync layers.

The residual blast radius, as originally written here, was a governed,
injection-scanned JSON registry write and read-only GitHub/SQL access — **not**
untrusted code execution.

**[Amendment, added alongside `agentic/executor/`.]** That last clause needs a
correction, stated as plainly as the rest of this section: **code execution now
exists.** `agentic/executor/runner.py::run_verification` runs `pytest`, `ruff`,
and the invariant guard as real subprocesses over a worktree. This section's
own conclusion — that microVM containment isn't needed — still holds, but for a
narrower and more precise reason than "nothing executes":

- **The shipped contract does not accept anonymous third-party workloads.** It is either nothing yet (as
  of this amendment, no live caller produces a worktree with a model-authored
  diff in it — see the module's own docstring for exactly what's wired and what
  isn't; **superseded by the third amendment below, where that caller now
  exists**), or, once a future phase wires a real planner and git-write flow, a
  patch the operator's own configured model proposed against the operator's own
  repository, already passed through the injection scan (§2), running through
  the operator's own pinned dev toolchain (`pytest`/`ruff`/the invariant guard —
  not an arbitrary command the patch gets to choose). This is a materially
  different threat than "run whatever an anonymous multi-tenant user uploads,"
  which is the threat gVisor/Firecracker primarily target. The later amendments
  supersede the "nothing yet" state: the real-repo path now exists, remains
  default-off and human-gated, and is only a soft process boundary. If the
  target repository or its tests are untrusted, Stage 5 becomes mandatory.

  **[Second amendment, added alongside the loop driver and git-write surface.]**
  Two of the three pieces that sentence called "future phase" now exist, each
  independently, and neither changes the conclusion above:

  - **A model-driven planner loop** (`agentic/harness_optimizer/loop_driver.py`)
    runs a plan → patch → verify → review cycle, but "verify" there means the
    existing deterministic train/holdout case checks and governance inspection
    `GitHubCodingRunner.evaluate()` already performed pre-amendment — it never
    calls `run_verification`, and it only ever overlays a candidate onto the
    committed 4-file fixture repository copied into a tempdir, never a real
    clone. It cannot produce a worktree for the executor to run against.
  - **A local git-write surface** (`agentic.deepagent_github.repo_workspace.
    RepoWorkspaceTools.checkout_branch`/`add`/`commit`/`diff`) can now commit
    inside the path-scoped clone `RepoWorkspaceTools.clone()` populates — still
    local only (no `push`, no GitHub API call), gated on its own
    default-`False` `deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools` flag, and with
    the committer identity always forced to this project's own convention
    (never the operator's).

  Neither module calls the other, and neither calls `run_verification`. The
  loop driver never sees a real repository; the git-write surface never runs a
  test or a linter. So the residual risk section above still describes the
  honest state precisely: a real "planner proposes a diff against a real clone,
  it gets committed, and the executor verifies that commit" pipeline does not
  exist yet — three independently-shipped, independently-tested, independently
  gated pieces do, each smaller than the pipeline the first amendment
  described, and none of them wired to either of the others.
  **Superseded by the third amendment below: that pipeline now exists, and
  the loop driver referenced here is a distinct, still-unwired module — see
  its own entry for what remains unconnected.**

  **[Third amendment: that pipeline now exists.]** `agentic/real_repo_loop.py::
  run_real_repo_loop` is the fusion the second amendment said didn't exist yet,
  and the first live caller of `run_verification` in this codebase. What it
  actually does, precisely: clone a real repository (`RepoWorkspaceTools`),
  ask the configured local model for a patch, write each proposed file through
  `RepoWorkspaceTools.write_file` (new in this change — the write-side
  counterpart to its existing reads, same path-safety validation as the git
  ops), and run the CALLER'S declared verification checks against the real
  worktree. It stops there — accepting a candidate does NOT commit it.
  Committing is a deliberate, separate later call, `finalize_real_repo_change`,
  driven by an explicit human `approve`/`reject` decision (a `reject` never
  touches git at all). Still local only: no `push`, no PR, no GitHub API call,
  regardless of the decision. `RepoWorkspaceTools.attach` exists so that
  decision can come from a LATER, separate process re-opening the same clone
  by path — the CLI-subprocess-per-call model I6 requires (see
  `utils/ops_runner.py`) can't hold a live Python object across two HTTP
  requests, so the clone's path on disk, not an in-memory handle, is what
  survives between "this passed its checks" and "a human said yes."

  What is gated, and how, stated exactly rather than "it's gated":

  - Three conditions checked once at the top of the run, mirroring
    `agentic/writer.py`'s own "no anonymous mutations" shape:
    `deepagent_github.allow_git_write_tools` is `True`, a non-empty human
    `reason` string, and explicit `confirm=True`. Each of `write_file`/`add`/
    `commit` ALSO re-checks `allow_git_write_tools` independently — the
    upfront check exists to fail fast (before spending a model call and a
    verification run), not to replace the low-level ones.
  - Every proposed file's content is injection-scanned
    (`inspect_candidate_text`) before verification runs; a critical finding
    skips verification entirely (no point running tests against known-bad
    content) and forces rejection.
  - Verification `checks` are a REQUIRED caller argument, never defaulted —
    `agentic.executor.default_checks()` assumes this repository's own
    toolchain (a CyClaw-specific invariant-guard path) and would be a wrong,
    invented assumption for an arbitrary configured target. An empty check
    list is rejected outright rather than silently accepting everything.
  - The git commit message is always a caller-supplied fixed string, never
    raw model output — the one place in this pipeline that deliberately does
    NOT trust the planner's own words.

  **The residual risk is real, and is exactly the executor's own risk,
  inherited unchanged.** `run_verification`'s environment scrub is still a
  soft, software-only control (§4's bullet above); it does not become a
  hard sandbox by having a real caller. A verification check that itself
  executes attacker-shaped code (a hostile test file the model proposed, that
  the caller's own declared checks happen to run) carries the same residual
  as before — a pinned working directory (not a filesystem jail), scrubbed env,
  and wall-clock timeout. API-key variables are removed, but `HOME` remains
  inherited and ordinary sockets remain available. An operator should read "accepted" as "the
  checks I named passed against this patch," not as "this patch is safe" —
  the human `reason` and `confirm` gates exist so that reading is a deliberate
  choice, not an assumption baked into the tooling.

  **What still does not exist, as of this amendment:** no CLI subcommand, HTTP
  route, or background caller invokes `run_real_repo_loop` — it ships fully
  tested and standalone, the same deferred-wiring call made for every prior
  capability in this effort. No cloud-provider planner is wired here either
  (still local-only, `LocalProposerClient`). Those remain explicit future
  work, not silently implied to already exist.
  **Superseded by the fifth amendment below: both now exist.**

  **Two correctness gaps an external review caught, both fixed.** First: the
  planner received only the operator's free-text instruction and prior
  rejection feedback — never the repository content or task context. A
  `--pr`/`--issue` run's already-fetched, already-injection-scanned title,
  body, and diff were discarded before the model call, so the planner had to
  guess complete replacement files blind. `run_real_repo_loop` now accepts an
  optional, bounded `context` string folded into every iteration's prompt;
  `agentic/cli.py::cmd_real_repo_run` supplies it from the fetched bundle when
  one exists. This is plumbing, not a new read surface: the planner still
  cannot browse the clone or request specific files mid-loop. Second: because
  `write_file` mutates the same persistent clone across iterations (there is
  no reset between attempts — `feedback` is meant to build ON the prior
  attempt, not replace it), a rejected early iteration's file could remain on
  disk and be required for a LATER, accepted iteration's checks to pass, while
  only that later iteration's own file list was staged for commit. A `checks`
  configuration that depended on an earlier file could pass verification
  while the approved commit silently omitted it.
  `RealRepoLoopResult.changed_files` now unions every iteration's writes, and
  `cmd_real_repo_run`/`finalize_real_repo_change` use that union rather than
  the last iteration's own list. That union is then re-checked against
  `protected_write_paths` inside `finalize_real_repo_change` before anything is
  staged, because the list it receives comes back off a persisted JSON record
  rather than from the in-memory result the diff-scope gate cleared. The gap
  they can drift through is ordinary rather than adversarial: the decide command
  is a separate process invocation, so an operator who tightens
  `protected_write_paths` between the run and the decision would otherwise have
  the commit scoped by the policy that applied when the model proposed. The
  parameter is required, not defaulted, so no caller can skip it silently.
  Containment is a separate and already-closed concern — `tools.add` routes each
  path through `_validate_write_path`, so nothing can be staged outside the
  clone regardless.
- **The residual risk this changes is real and is named, not hidden.** A
  hostile test file (for example a `conftest.py` with a direct network or file
  operation) can run arbitrary code with the executor subprocess's privileges.
  The compensating controls are a pinned `cwd`, a scrubbed but not empty
  environment, fixed caller-declared argv, a hard per-check wall-clock timeout,
  and `check=False` so non-zero exit is data rather than an exception. None is a
  filesystem or network jail. In the shipped Compose container, the process can
  read anything UID 1000 can read and write the six mounted carve-outs. In a
  native macOS run, it executes as the operator account and can reach every
  operator-readable or operator-writable path. Both variants can use ordinary
  TCP/UDP sockets and see the inherited `HOME`. API keys are removed from the
  child environment, but files or credential helpers beneath `HOME` are not
  made unreachable.
- **What this does NOT change:** GitHub writes remain unreachable on a shipped
  checkout — though as of 2026-08-07 that is held by `agentic.enabled: false`
  alone rather than by four independent gates (see the fourth and eighth
  amendments below), SQL is still
  read-only-guarded, and filesystem writes are still triple-gated. The executor
  itself never chooses WHAT to run — the argv is fixed, non-attacker-chosen,
  operator- or config-supplied — but correcting an earlier overclaim: it does
  not follow that nothing it runs can write. Its `cwd` is the same worktree
  `run_real_repo_loop` just wrote model-authored content into, so the shipped
  default check (`pytest`) can and does write there in the ordinary course of
  test collection and execution — a hostile `conftest.py` reaching disk is
  exactly the residual risk named in the bullet above, not a separate one.

### Fourth amendment — the GitHub write path is implemented (P10)

- **What changed.** `execute_write()` was a stub that raised
  `NotImplementedError`. It now performs `gh pr create --draft` for real, and
  `RepoWorkspaceTools.push_branch()` can push one `claude/` branch to origin.
  The sentence "GitHub writes are hard-killed" was true of the code and is no
  longer; the §5 bullet above has been rewritten rather than left standing.
- **What did NOT change at P10 time: the shipped posture.** `EXECUTION_ENABLED`
  was still `False`, and `agentic.enabled` / `agentic.mode` /
  `agentic.writes_enabled` still shipped closed. Six independent gates, any one
  of which refuses (see `docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md`'s gate-chain
  table). P10 deliberately did not flip the flag — arming it is a
  filed-checklist operator procedure, matching how the analogous fsconnect write
  enablement was handled.
  **Superseded 2026-08-07:** the checklist was signed and the flag and config
  gates were opened. See the eighth amendment. This bullet is retained as the
  P10-era record, not as a description of the current tree.
- **What is gated, exactly.** `execute_write()` checks `agentic.enabled` first
  -- an external review caught that this master switch was, until then,
  enforced only by the CLI's own disabled-no-op, not by `_require_gates()`
  itself, so a direct programmatic call could bypass it. `execute_write()` then
  requires a FRESH `confirm=True` from its own caller: an earlier version
  manufactured `confirm=True` internally when re-running the gate, which made
  that gate unconditionally satisfied rather than a real per-call check -- the
  same review caught this too. With both fixed, `execute_write()` re-runs the
  master switch plus all four numbered gates against the live config on every
  call, so possessing a plan dict is not authority to write. It rebuilds the
  argv from the plan's own params and refuses on mismatch, so a tampered
  `would_run` is inert. It refuses a plan naming a repo other than the
  configured one. It refuses any op outside `{pr_create}` even though three
  are describable. It never retries: both of `run_read`'s retry branches fire
  after the request has left the machine, so a retry could duplicate an
  accepted mutation; a timeout is reported as INDETERMINATE.
- **The residual risk, named.** With the flag armed and the config gates opened,
  this code can push a `claude/*` branch and open a draft PR against the
  configured repo as the authenticated `gh` identity. It cannot push to `main`,
  force-push, or delete. Two honest gaps: `push_branch` inherits the operator's
  ambient git credential helper (CyClaw passes no token of its own, deliberately
  — the environment it would live in is shared with the executor that runs
  model-proposed commands), and `agentic/executor`'s operator-supplied check
  argv can already run `git push` inside the clone, bypassing the `claude/*`
  scoping. The second is pre-existing, operator-supplied rather than
  model-supplied, and is called out as item H of the enablement checklist.
- **What still does not exist:** `pr_comment` and `issue_comment` execution,
  and any `/ops/*` route reaching a write. **Superseded in part by the sixth
  amendment below:** the other three items this bullet used to claim — a
  harness route reaching a write, a CLI write subcommand, and wiring into the
  real-repo loop's approve step — all now exist, and a GitHub mutation is
  network-triggerable once the flag is flipped. Only the `pr_comment`/
  `issue_comment` and `/ops/*` clauses still hold.

MicroVM containment would still add operational weight and privileged host
requirements most single-operator deployments of CyClaw cannot assume. It
remains the honest next step (§6, stage 5) if the threat model ever widens
beyond "verify a change to my own configured repo" — e.g., if this executor
were ever pointed at a repo, or dev-toolchain command, the operator did not
themselves configure. Until that widening happens, stage 5 stays conditional,
not because nothing executes, but because what executes is scoped, known, and
not attacker-chosen at the command level.

### Fifth amendment — `run_real_repo_loop` now has real callers, including one with a cloud-provider planner

- **What changed.** The third amendment's "what still does not exist" bullet
  is stale: `agentic/cli.py`'s `real-repo-run` subcommand calls
  `run_real_repo_loop` directly, and `harness/server.py`'s `POST
  /api/agent/run` reaches the same loop through the `utils.ops_runner`
  subprocess shim — a real CLI subcommand and a real HTTP route both exist
  now, not merely a tested-but-standalone module.
- **The HTTP route is not a new unauthenticated surface.** It is one of the
  harness's P9 routes: `require_api_key` (fail-closed on an unset
  `CYCLAW_API_KEY`) plus an `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` same-origin check guard
  it, alongside the paired `GET /api/agent/runs/{id}` status read and `POST
  /api/agent/runs/{id}/decision` human approve/reject endpoint — the same
  decision point `real-repo-run-decide` already required at the CLI layer.
- **A cloud-provider planner is wired, and unlike the DeepAgents-graph path
  the egress table row above describes, this one records egress.**
  `agentic/cli.py`'s `--provider {grok,claude}` flag (paired with
  `--confirm-online`) constructs `agentic.deepagent_github.chat_client.
  ChatModelProposerClient` behind the same six-condition chain named in the
  egress table row (`allow_cloud_providers`, `providers.<name>.enabled`, the
  provider's API key, `--confirm-online`), gates checked eagerly before any
  network I/O. `ChatModelProposerClient.invoke` calls `sanitize_handoff` on
  every real invocation before the model call — the egress table row's
  caveat ("not recorded as egress") describes ONLY the separate, still-unwired
  `builder.py`/`create_deep_agent` path; it was never true of this path and
  should not be read as a blanket statement about all cloud egress in the
  agentic layer.
- **What still does not exist.** The `builder.py`/DeepAgents-graph path
  (`create_deep_agent`) remains probe-only — `agentic/cli.py`'s
  `deepagent-plan` subcommand deliberately never calls `.invoke()` on it, by
  its own docstring. **Retired (owner decision, 2026-07-31): no further
  development is planned on this path** — `run_real_repo_loop` is the one
  live real-repo coding pipeline going forward; see
  `docs/work/GITHUB_DEEP_AGENT_HARNESS_OPTIMIZER_PLAN.md`'s own
  retirement note.

### Sixth amendment — the write path is now network-reachable (still disarmed)

- **What changed.** The fifth amendment above said `push_branch`/`execute_write`
  were "still not forwarded through any harness HTTP route, which only passes
  `decision` today." That was true when written and is no longer. Both are now
  reachable three ways: `agentic.cli`'s `real-repo-run-decide --push/--publish`
  (one-shot), the standalone `real-repo-run-push`/`real-repo-run-publish`
  subcommands, and — the material change — `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/push`
  and `POST /api/agent/runs/{id}/publish` on the harness. A third route,
  `POST .../discard`, reclaims a clone and reaches no write.
- **So "GitHub writes are un-triggerable over the network" is retired as a
  claim.** Once `EXECUTION_ENABLED` is flipped, an authenticated, same-origin
  caller on loopback can open a draft PR against an approved-and-pushed run.
  What still bounds it: `CYCLAW_API_KEY` (fail-closed) plus an
  `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` check on every one of those routes, the run-state
  guards (`require_approved_for_push`, `require_pushed_for_publish`), and the
  six write gates themselves. The per-invocation blast radius is unchanged —
  one `claude/*` branch, one draft PR, no force-push, no delete.
- **What did NOT change at the time of this amendment: the shipped posture.**
  `EXECUTION_ENABLED` was still a hardcoded `False` that no config file could
  flip, and `allow_git_write_tools`/`agentic.enabled`/`mode`/`writes_enabled`
  all still shipped closed. Nothing in *that* amendment armed anything.
  **Superseded 2026-08-07** — the flag, `mode`, and `writes_enabled` are now
  open; `allow_git_write_tools` and `agentic.enabled` still ship `false`. See
  the eighth amendment.
- **This is the checklist's own trigger, and it fired.**
  `docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md` item A said that if reachability
  ever changed the checklist was void and had to be re-run. It was re-run on
  2026-07-31; that document, not this one, is authoritative on the gate chain
  and carries the open operator decisions.

### Seventh amendment — Telegram channel (out-of-band, default-off)

- **What changed (2026-08-03; expanded 2026-08-04).** A new out-of-band package `telegram/` can
  reach the Telegram Bot API for outbound notify (mode `notify`) and, when
  configured, long-poll inbound chat (mode `chat`). Inbound text is turned into
  answers **only** by HTTP `POST /query` to the existing loopback CyClaw server
  (`telegram.query.base_url` is validated to loopback). Design:
  `docs/channels/TELEGRAM_DESIGN.md`.
- **What this does NOT change.** Graph topology, triple-gate hybrid, soul
  governance, agentic write disarm, and the I6 import boundary are unchanged.
  `gate.py` / `graph.py` / `mcp_hybrid_server.py` do **not** import `telegram`.
  The channel never derives `user_confirmed_online=true` from ordinary message
  text. When its default-off T3 master switch is enabled, only the exact,
  provider-specific `/online on <grok|claude>` command creates a one-shot,
  short-lived consent record; the next non-command message claims and deletes
  it before `/query`. Core `mode=hybrid` and provider-enabled gates remain the
  final authority.
- **Shipped posture.** `telegram.enabled: false`, `mode: notify`, empty
  `allowed_chat_ids`. Enabling with an empty allowlist is a **config load
  error**. Bot token is env-only (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` by default). T3 consent
  and T4 attachment staging are both independently default-off.
- **Threat surface added (honest).** Telegram's cloud sees message plaintext
  for any traffic the operator sends or receives through the bot. This is
  **not** offline end-to-end privacy for the chat channel; local RAG inference
  still runs on-box, but the *transport* is third-party. Branding and MSP
  narratives must not claim otherwise.
- **Controls.** Chat-id allowlist; loopback-only CyClaw base URL; audit events
  (`telegram_inbound` / `telegram_outbound` / `telegram_query`) with query
  hashing and token fingerprint only; no webhook listener (long-poll only);
  no multi-tenant isolation claims. T3 state contains only expiry/provider,
  uses per-session locking and atomic replacement, and is consumed before the
  query. T4 accepts only allowlisted private-chat photos/documents with an
  explicit caption confirmation, strips user-controlled filename/MIME from its
  write decision, bounds Bot API download size, requires fsconnect's enabled,
  write, strict-root, scan, injection-block, and persistent write-rate-limit
  gates; requires an absolute root outside the repository/corpus and separate
  from read roots; and runs the existing fsconnect CLI with fixed argv and
  stdin. T4 does not auto-index or write the corpus.
- **Residual risk.** A stolen bot token + knowledge of an allowlisted chat id
  can send messages as the bot and, if `mode: chat` and CyClaw is up, submit
  queries as the operator would over `/query`. Treat the token like an API key;
  rotate via BotFather if leaked. Compromised Telegram infrastructure is out of
  CyClaw's control (same class as any cloud chat product).
- **What still does not exist.** Webhook mode, media→corpus auto-ingest,
  group multi-user ACLs, Telegram routing into the terminal/harness UI, and an
  in-process scheduler inside `gate.py`. T4 remains rollout-partial pending a
  disposable-root live validation and a separately reviewed replay/ingest
  policy.

### Eighth amendment — the operator armed the write path and hybrid mode (2026-08-07)

**This amendment supersedes every "ships disarmed / off by default" statement
about the GitHub write path and the external providers elsewhere in this
document.** Where an earlier amendment says the posture did not change, it is
describing its own point in time and is retained as a historical record.

- **What happened.** The operator signed
  `docs/agentic/GITHUB_WRITE_ENABLEMENT.md`'s security-review checklist
  (`Sign-off: CG, 8.7.2026`) and, in the same commit, opened the write and
  hybrid gates. A follow-up PR reconciled the config so it validates and
  updated the tests that pinned the disarmed posture.
- **Core plane (I3), now two of three gates open.** `app.mode: "hybrid"` and
  both `models.grok.enabled` / `models.claude.enabled` ship `true`. Only
  `user_confirmed_online` remains, and it is a per-request field — see §4's
  qualifier: it is self-asserted by the caller on an unauthenticated `/query`,
  so it is a single-trusted-operator assumption, not an enforced control. An
  unset `GROK_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` still fails the path closed
  (`is_available()` is presence-only, so a placeholder key such as the
  documented `GROK_API_KEY=dummy` satisfies it and the request still leaves
  the box before auth fails).
- **What is NOT sent.** Unchanged and still verified: `send_local_context_to_grok`
  and `send_local_context_to_claude` both ship `false`, so retrieved local
  context is excluded; the soul/identity block is never forwarded; the outbound
  payload is the query text only, capped at 8000 chars per provider.
- **Agentic plane.** `EXECUTION_ENABLED` ships `True`; `agentic.mode: "write"`
  and `agentic.writes_enabled: true` ship open; `allow_cloud_providers` and both
  `providers.<name>.enabled` ship `true`. Still closed: `agentic.enabled`,
  `deepagent_github.enabled`, `allow_git_write_tools`, `allow_github_writes`,
  `allow_filesystem_write_tools`, `allow_shell_execution`.
- **Gate depth on a GitHub mutation collapsed from six to three.**
  `agentic.enabled`, plus the per-call `reason` and `confirm` — and the latter
  two are supplied by the same request that asks for the write. **`agentic.enabled`
  is now the only standing barrier not self-attested by the caller.** Treat
  flipping `config.yaml`'s `agentic.enabled` as a High-tier change: it is no
  longer "turn on the read-only agentic CLI."
- **Rollback.** `CYCLAW_AGENTIC_WRITE_DISABLE=1` closes the code-level gate with
  no source edit. Disable-only by construction (AND-ed with `EXECUTION_ENABLED`,
  never OR-ed), so it cannot arm a build that ships disarmed.
- **Item H's sharpening is real but not yet live.** The checklist's accepted
  executor-argv gap (a `--checks-file` entry invoking `git push` reaches the
  operator's `HOME`-resident credential helper, bypassing `push_branch`'s
  `claude/*` scoping) requires `agentic.enabled` **and**
  `deepagent_github.enabled` **and** `allow_git_write_tools` — all still
  `false`, so the executor is unreachable today. What changed is that arming
  step 2 (`gh auth setup-git`) puts the ambient credential on the operator's
  machine permanently, where no in-repo control can see it. Before: two
  barriers. After: one. The harness HTTP path is unaffected — it sends check
  *profile names* against a fixed four-entry allowlist and never raw argv, so
  this remains a local-CLI-only gap.
- **A `--checks-file` is now a credential-bearing artifact.** It is parsed into
  arbitrary argv with no allowlist and executed with `HOME` present. Never
  accept one from a model, a PR diff, an issue body, or a corpus document.
- **`/health` egress.** `/health` carries neither auth nor a rate limit, and
  under `mode: hybrid` its provider-liveness probes were authenticated outbound
  calls any local process — or any page in the operator's browser, `GET` being
  CORS-simple — could trigger. Those probes are now opt-in via
  `api.health_probe_external_providers`, which ships `false`.
- **A posture regression cannot fail a build, though a config *error* can.**
  `invariant-guard` passes 33/33 because I1–I6 and G1–G5 are structural and none
  encodes a shipped-default posture. `config-guard` **is** build-blocking:
  `ci.yml`'s `discover-skills` job finds every `.claude/skills/*/verify.sh` by
  `find` and runs them as the `verify-skills` matrix, and `config-guard`'s
  `verify.sh` runs the checker against the real shipped `config.yaml` and fails
  the job on a non-zero exit. So C1–C8/C10/C11 **failures** do block a merge.
  What does not block is a **warning**: `C9` (external/online posture), `C7`
  (RRF-scale `min_score`) and `C12` (context arithmetic) exit 0, and `--strict`
  — which promotes warnings to failures — is used only inside `verify.sh`'s own
  mutation self-test, never against the shipped file. Wiring `--strict` against
  the real config would fail immediately and for the wrong reason: the hybrid
  posture is deliberate, so `C9` would have to be silenced to go green, which is
  the same "resolve a fail-closed objection by removing the objection" pattern
  this amendment warns about two bullets down. The honest statement is that the
  posture warning is advisory by design.

  *(Corrected 2026-08-07. This bullet previously said "no CI workflow runs it",
  which was wrong — the wiring is dynamic, so grepping the workflows for
  `config-guard` finds nothing and the literal search misleads. The conclusion
  it drew about posture regressions happened to be right for a different
  reason.)*
- **The rollback story is inverted.** Armed is now the shipped default, so
  disarming is the deviation: three tests pin the armed state, and a plain
  `git revert` of the flag fails CI. The `CYCLAW_AGENTIC_WRITE_DISABLE` switch
  exists precisely so a safety action does not have to fight the test suite.

## 6. Hardening maturity ladder

**Production isolation reality: 4/10 relative to hostile-workload containment
with gVisor/Firecracker.** The current baseline is proportionate for the stated
trusted, single-operator model, but it does not contain a container-host kernel
escape, ordinary-socket exfiltration, destructive writes inside carve-outs, or
hostile verification code. Falco is detection-only and disabled by default.

| Stage | Control | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Loopback bind, non-root, telemetry-kill, injection filter, topology invariants | ✅ Done |
| 1 | `no-new-privileges`, `cap_drop: ALL`, read-only rootfs, resource limits, explicit Docker builtin seccomp | ✅ Enforced |
| 2 | eBPF **detection** (Falco) over agentic/sync/gate, disabled-by-default | ✅ Scaffold shipped (`deploy/falco/`) |
| 3 | eBPF-profiled, tight gate-specific seccomp allowlist | 🟡 Capture procedure shipped; native traces/replay pending |
| 4 | AppArmor filesystem/network confinement; Landlock equivalent | 🟡 Opt-in single-container profile shipped; native enforcement pending; Landlock deferred |
| 5 | gVisor / Firecracker around any future *untrusted-workload* mode | ⏸ Not justified; mandatory only if the threat model changes |

Stage 3 deliberately depends on real tracing. The former 17-syscall x86-only
floor and the applied sync/rclone profile were deleted because neither was a
validated gate policy. A correct profile must be generated from real eBPF
traces, reviewed against the matching Moby default without dropping its
argument/capability filters, and replayed on both supported architectures.
Until then the gate runs under Docker's builtin. Stage 4's candidate confines
the whole gate container: external `/ops` executables fail closed, while
Python-only `/ops` children remain possible and inherit the same profile. It is
not process-role isolation; optional services need their own profiles. Stage 5
criteria and the full operator procedure are in
[`docs/SECCOMP_EBPF_HARDENING.md`](./SECCOMP_EBPF_HARDENING.md).
