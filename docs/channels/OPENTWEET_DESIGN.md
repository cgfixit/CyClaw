# OpenTweet X channel (v1)

Out-of-band CyClaw channel. Telegram analog. Default-off.

## Goal

A weekly generated scheduler (macOS LaunchAgent + Windows Task Scheduler)
calls loopback `POST /query` with an operator topic, validates the answer,
and creates an OpenTweet **draft** (opt-in `scheduled_date`). Never a graph
node. Never X/Tweepy. Never hosted OpenTweet MCP (`mcp.opentweet.io`).

## Topology

```
weekly LaunchAgent / Windows task   (generate-don't-load, shipped off)
  → keychain-env / CredMan-env  OPENTWEET_API_KEY
  → keychain-env / CredMan-env  CYCLAW_API_KEY (optional)
  → python -m opentweet.cli post --topic-file <path>
       POST 127.0.0.1:8787/query  user_confirmed_online=false
       validate answer
       GET  https://opentweet.io/api/v1/me
       POST https://opentweet.io/api/v1/posts   draft | scheduled_date
       audit hashed event only
```

I6: `gate.py` / `gate_ops.py` / `gate_auth.py` / `gate_memory.py` /
`graph.py` / `mcp_hybrid_server.py` never import `opentweet`; `opentweet`
never imports them or sibling OOB packages.

## Operator surface

```bash
python -m opentweet.cli status
python -m opentweet.cli test
python -m opentweet.cli post --dry-run --topic "soul governance"
python -m opentweet.cli schedule-plist   # Darwin; does not bootstrap
python -m opentweet.cli schedule-task    # Windows; does not register
```

Keychain/CredMan service: `com.cgfixit.cyclaw.opentweet-api-key`.
Launchd label: `com.cgfixit.cyclaw.opentweet`.
Task name: `CyClaw opentweet`.
Topic file (documented default): `~/.CyClaw/opentweet-topic.txt`.

Shipped `config.yaml` has `opentweet.enabled: false`. Generators no-op
until enabled. `post` refuses (exit 3) while disabled.

## Fail-closed (no OpenTweet write)

Disabled channel; missing/empty/oversized topic; missing `OPENTWEET_API_KEY`;
`/query` error, `hit_count==0`, `needs_confirm`, online `model_used`; empty
or `[`-prefixed or >280-char answer; unauthenticated `/me`; scheduling
without subscription/`can_post`; past `scheduled_date`; `--dry-run`.

Audit events: `opentweet_query`, `opentweet_draft`, `opentweet_scheduled`,
`opentweet_dry_run`, `opentweet_refused`. Fields: hashes, lengths, ids,
mode. Never raw text, never Bearer tokens.

## Threat notes

This is a **public-write** egress — SECURITY.md class 3 (intentional, policy-gated feature traffic from a first-party httpx client; no vendor SDK, no SDK telemetry key; never labeled telemetry, never blocked by the kill map). The human gate is the OpenTweet
dashboard (draft default; opt-in `scheduled_date` still leaves a review
window before the slot). Corpus-derived text must not appear in launchd
or Task Scheduler logs. Loopback `/query` keeps I1–I5 on the generation
path. Do not set `user_confirmed_online`. Do not add this package to the
core import set.

## Automatic scheduling content boundary

Before automatic scheduling, CyClaw scans the topic and final answer through
the shared injection filter. A disabled or empty filter refuses scheduling.
Generated URL/domain/email shapes, mentions and hashtags are refused because
this path cannot establish their source provenance. These checks also apply
to schedule dry runs. Drafts retain the existing validation and remain available
for human review. Pattern screening is a deterministic refusal rule, not proof
that all hostile prose or unsupported claims have been detected.
