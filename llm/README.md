# `llm/` — model clients

One module, `client.py`, holding the three HTTP clients the graph's answer
nodes use. No routing or policy lives here — which client gets called is
decided entirely by `graph.py`'s edges and `gate.py`'s construction gates
(invariants I2/I3); these classes only speak the wire protocols.

## Clients

| Class | Backend | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| `LocalLLMClient` | Ollama (default) or LM Studio | OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` on loopback (or an operator-listed `models.local_llm.trusted_hosts` entry); ignores ambient `HTTP(S)_PROXY` (`trust_env=False`) so localhost traffic can't be redirected off-box |
| `GrokClient` | x.ai | OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions`; ignores ambient `HTTP(S)_PROXY` (`trust_env=False`) so `GROK_API_KEY` cannot transit an operator proxy |
| `ClaudeClient` | Anthropic | Messages API; ignores ambient `HTTP(S)_PROXY` (`trust_env=False`) so `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` cannot transit an operator proxy |

The two external clients are only ever **constructed** when
`mode == "hybrid"` and the provider's `enabled` flag is true, and only ever
**called** after per-request user confirmation — the triple gate (I3) is
enforced in `gate.py` + `graph.py`, not here.

Read that conditional against the shipped config before assuming it means
"off": `app.mode` ships `"hybrid"` and both `models.grok.enabled` and
`models.claude.enabled` ship `true` (armed 2026-08-07), so on a fresh clone
**both external clients are constructed at boot** and two of the three gates
are already open. The only remaining gate is the per-request
`user_confirmed_online`, which cannot be pre-set in config. Billed calls are
recorded to `logs/spend.jsonl` — see [`docs/spend/README.md`](../docs/spend/README.md).

## Shared behavior

- **Bounded retry** (`_post_with_retry`): transport errors, 5xx and 429 retry
  with exponential backoff; other 4xx fail fast (retrying a 400/401 wastes
  time and, for Grok, credits). Timeouts retry for `GrokClient`/`ClaudeClient`
  only — `LocalLLMClient` passes `retry_on_timeout=False`, so a stalled Ollama
  read fails fast rather than burning a second full `timeout_sec`.
  Config-driven via each model's `retry` block; absent block = single attempt
  (the shipped `config.yaml` sets `max_retries: 2` on all three models, i.e. up
  to three attempts). A `Retry-After` header on a 429/5xx is honored in place
  of the exponential delay, clamped to `backoff_max_sec`. Every sleep is also
  checked against the per-request graph deadline (`api.graph_timeout_sec`,
  set via `set_graph_deadline`): when the remaining budget cannot cover the
  pending backoff plus another POST, the retry is abandoned and the client
  raises its timeout error immediately instead of outliving the 504 (#1359).
- **Local failover** (`models.local_llm.fallback`): optional boot-time probe
  that prefers the primary backend (Ollama) and falls back to the secondary
  (LM Studio) if unreachable; selection cached per process. Ships disabled so
  single-backend installs stay fail-closed.
- Timeouts and model names come from `config.yaml` (`models.local_llm.*`,
  `models.grok.*`, `models.claude.*`) — see `CLAUDE.md` §2 "Load-bearing
  numbers" for the ones that interact (e.g. `api.graph_timeout_sec` (780) must
  exceed `models.local_llm.timeout_sec` (720)).
