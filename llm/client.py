"""Local OpenAI-compatible LLM (Ollama / LM Studio), Grok, and Claude clients.

Local backends and Grok use the OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions endpoint.
Claude uses Anthropic's Messages API.

Transient failures (timeouts, transport/network errors, and retryable HTTP
statuses — 5xx and 429) are retried with bounded exponential backoff. Client
errors (other 4xx) and unexpected exceptions fail fast — retrying a 400/401
only wastes time and, for Grok, external credits. Retry is config-driven via a
``retry`` block under each model; when absent, ``max_retries`` defaults to 0,
preserving the original single-attempt behavior.

Optional local failover (``models.local_llm.fallback``): when enabled, a short
HTTP probe prefers the primary (Ollama) and, if unreachable, selects the
secondary (LM Studio). Selection is cached for the process; default is
fallback disabled so single-backend installs stay fail-closed.

    ``retry_on_timeout=False`` makes a read timeout fail fast (no retry), while
    transport/5xx/429 still retry. This is the right policy for a local Ollama
    backend: a read timeout there means inference is *stalled* (the classic
    "0% processing"), so a retry just issues a second request that waits the full
    per-call ``timeout_sec`` again — and, because the gateway wraps the whole graph
    in a shorter ``api.graph_timeout_sec`` deadline, the extra attempt is already
    unreachable (the client returns 504 first) and only orphans a worker thread on
    a second stalled call. Cloud Grok and Claude keep the default (transient
    network blips behind their short timeout are worth a retry).

    Each transient retry logs a WARNING and each terminal give-up / fail-fast a
    ERROR, tagged with ``service`` (e.g. ``ollama`` / ``grok``), the attempt
    count, and the failure category. Only network/HTTP metadata is logged —
    never the prompt or response body — so the breadcrumb is safe for the audit
    trail. This turns previously-silent retries (a multi-minute Ollama stall
    would leave no trace) into an observable signal. Deliberately not stated as
    a concrete duration: the worst case is a multiple of the caller's own
    ``timeout_sec``, so any figure written here drifts the moment that is retuned.
