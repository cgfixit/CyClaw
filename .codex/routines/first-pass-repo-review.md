# First-Pass Repo Review

## When To Use

Use this when starting unfamiliar work in CyClaw, reviewing a new area, or validating setup before edits.

## Inputs To Ask For

- Target task, issue, PR, or subsystem.
- Whether the user wants code changes or only a report.
- Any time or verification constraints.

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Skim `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
3. Inspect the root listing, relevant package manifests, CI workflows, and docs.
4. Identify the owning subsystem: core gateway, graph, retrieval, utils, sync, agentic, guardrails, docs, or CI.
5. Check for existing tests and previous audit notes before proposing changes.
6. Summarize what already exists, what is missing, and the smallest safe next step.

## Verification Checklist

- Confirmed Python/package/test/lint commands from repo files.
- Found the canonical docs for the subsystem.
- Identified security invariants that could be affected.
- No edits made unless the user asked for implementation.

## Expected Final Response

- What was inspected.
- Key findings and risks.
- Recommended next action.
- Commands run, if any, with outcomes.
