# Sync CyClaw Documentation

Use the maintained checker under `.claude/skills/doc-sync/` as the single
mechanical implementation. This Codex skill defines how to use its evidence
without copying a second parser or treating prose as executable truth. The
repo-local `doc_sync.py` and `verify.sh` here forward to that maintained checker
and self-test, preserving the existing Codex command paths.

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant source, target diff, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the
   documentation surface being claimed. Do not begin from a historical drift
   list; re-check current `origin/main`.
2. Run the checker from the repository root:

   ```text
   python .claude/skills/doc-sync/doc_sync.py
   ```

   It validates skill inventory, console entry points, documented config
   values, sanitizer-pattern counts, route coverage, hook claims, graph
   node-count claims, and README paths, relative links, anchors, and Python
   module references. Its README discovery covers basenames starting with
   `readme` (case-insensitive); include `docs/SYNC_README.md` and
   `docs/agentic/AGENTIC_README.md` manually in a project-wide README pass. Exit 0 means no mechanical drift; it does not prove
   every prose assertion.
3. Perform a bounded manual pass where the change reaches: command docs versus
   implementation, install docs versus manifests/workflows, `AGENTS.md` versus
   `CLAUDE.md`, routines/prompts/checklists versus active Codex behavior, and
   security claims versus the threat model and source.
4. Update the derived document, never code/config/graph behavior merely to
   match stale prose. Treat a desired-but-absent behavior as a decision for the
   user, not a documentation repair.
5. When skills change, update both `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/README.md`; verify
   every Codex skill has `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, and a default prompt
   containing its exact `$skill-name`. Parse the frontmatter and UI metadata;
   the Claude doc-sync checker does not validate the complete Codex inventory.
   Preserve `allow_implicit_invocation` and unrelated interface fields. The
   historical `Cyclaw-Sandbox` directory intentionally invokes `$cyclaw-sandbox`.
6. Re-run the checker and `git diff --check`. Use the shell self-test below
   when the environment can run it.

## Verification

```text
bash .claude/skills/doc-sync/verify.sh
git diff --check
```

The shell mutation self-test requires native POSIX path handling. Git Bash
with Windows Python can pass `/c/...` paths inside `python -c` strings unchanged,
causing fixture setup to fail. On that combination, run the Python checker
directly and report the self-test limitation; do not label a fixture-path error
as product drift or a passing mutation test. A temporary Python-built fixture
can still verify CLI argument forwarding and expected drift exit codes. Do not claim a clean checker result
validates newly invented behavior, live integrations, or an untested command.

## Publication boundary

Keep documentation truth changes separate from runtime changes where possible.
Use a focused draft PR, state the source of truth and checks run, and never
push directly to `main`.
