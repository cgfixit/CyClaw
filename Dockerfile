# CyClaw Dockerfile - Production-grade, zero-trust, reproducible
# Python 3.12 + pip, installed from requirements.txt + constraints.txt.
# Seccomp/AppArmor ready. Non-root.
# Aligns with v1.9.0 pyproject + constraints for hermetic deps; CI uses requirements.txt for compat.

# Pinned to the multi-arch manifest-list digest of the 3.12-slim-bookworm tag
# (fetched from Docker Hub 2026-07-27): a bare tag is mutable, so a re-tagged/
# compromised base image would silently enter every build. The tag is kept
# alongside the digest for human readability; re-pin on any base-image bump.

# Dependency files first for layer caching
COPY pyproject.toml constraints.txt requirements.txt ./

# Install with plain pip against requirements.txt, NOT pyproject.toml/-e .:
# this build stage hasn't COPYed the actual source yet (the COPY above takes
# manifests only), so `-e .` could not build the cyclaw wheel here regardless.
#
# This line used to lead with `uv pip install ... 2>/dev/null || ( pip ... )`,
# uv being the fast resolver and pip the fallback. The uv half is gone because
# it could not succeed: constraints.txt pins setuptools (a torch transitive),
# the PyTorch CPU index mirrors setuptools but not that version, and uv's
# DEFAULT first-index strategy then refuses to consult PyPI for a package it
# already found on an earlier index -- a deliberate dependency-confusion
# guard, not a bug. So uv reported "no version of setuptools==<pin>" and every
# build fell through to pip, with `2>/dev/null` swallowing the reason.
# Reproduced 2026-09-11 against Python 3.12 with BOTH uv 0.7.22 (the
# generation this file used to pin) and uv 0.8.17, for `-r requirements.txt`
# and `-e .` alike. `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` does resolve, but it
# would hand EVERY package to whichever index has the best version -- the
# exact guard requirements.txt's own comment relies on -- so the honest fix is
# to run the path that was already doing the work. uv is referenced nowhere
# else in this repo (no workflow, no documented command).
#
# Step 1 pins pip itself (matches ci.yml's CVE/repro pin). Step 2 pre-installs
# the CPU torch wheel explicitly (mirrors ci.yml / pip-audit.yml): pip reads
# requirements.txt's own --extra-index-url, but pre-installing keeps the CPU
# wheel resolution independent of that line's ordering. Step 3 installs the
# rest under constraints.
# The torch pre-install MUST match the constraints.txt torch pin exactly --
# when constraints moved 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0 this line stayed behind, so the
# build installed 2.12.1 and then immediately failed the constrained resolve
# (verify-deps E5 and tests/test_isolation_deploy.py both pin the pair).
# Keep the two in lock-step on any bump.
# No stderr redirect and no `||` on this RUN: a dependency install that fails
# must fail the build loudly rather than silently take another path.
