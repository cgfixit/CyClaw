"""Password hashing, token minting, and lockout state for CyClaw's per-user
authentication.

Stage 1 of docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md: the pure primitives, with no
database, no HTTP, and no clock of their own. Password verification lives here
because it is what everything above it rests on and deserves to be reviewed on
its own; lockout arithmetic lives here because it is state-machine logic that
should be testable without a database or a clock; the id/token generators live
here because they are one-line wrappers over `secrets` that every layer above
needs and none should re-implement.

Stage 2 builds on this and DOES reach the request path -- utils/authn_store.py
(the account/session store), utils/authn_manager.py (AuthManager), and
gate_auth.py (/auth/login, /auth/logout, /auth/whoami) all sit above it. This
module still imports none of them: the dependency runs one way only, which is
what keeps these primitives testable in isolation. Enforcing a credential on
/query enforcement is Stage 3 (attached only when auth.enabled is true);
TLS on the socket is Stage 4.
