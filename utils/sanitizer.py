"""Prompt injection filter and input sanitization.

Strips known injection patterns and validates input length.
Also used at index time to sanitize corpus chunks.

The filter is driven entirely by ``config.yaml`` (``policy.prompt_filter``):
``enabled``, ``banned_patterns`` and ``max_input_chars``. Patterns are
compiled once per config file and cached, so the hot path (every /query and
every chunk at index time) does not recompile regexes on each call.
