"""PersonalityManager — Lean soul layer for CyClaw.

Based on soul.md as file-as-truth with a shadow DB for version history
and interaction logging. SHA-256 drift detection on startup.

Database backend: SQLite by default (zero-config, offline-first). Switch to
Postgres by setting CYCLAW_DB_URL=postgresql://... or personality.database_url
in config.yaml. See utils/personality_db.py for the connection shim.

Security: proposed soul evolutions are scanned before any write using the SAME
banned-pattern set the query path uses (config.yaml policy.prompt_filter), unioned
with a legacy OWASP baseline — so the soul (prepended to every LLM system prompt)
is no longer guarded by a weaker list than user queries. apply_evolution requires
an explicit human reason.
