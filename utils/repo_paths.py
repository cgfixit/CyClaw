"""Repo-relative path safety — used by ``utils.ops_runner``.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``agentic.deepagent_github.repo_workspace.canonical_repo_path`` is the jail's
source of truth for "will this path write/read under the clone root."
``utils.ops_runner`` must not import ``agentic`` (I6 / isolation), but it must
reject the same escapes *before* a staged path is forwarded as ``--read-file``.

This module is a stdlib-only mirror of that acceptance rule, plus one
deliberately stricter segment check documented on the function itself.
``tests/test_repo_paths.py`` pins both halves by comparing the two functions
directly: they must agree on the shared base contract, and diverge on exactly
one rule (trailing dot/space), which the write jail does not need. Comparing
rather than restating hard-coded expectations is the point -- a mirror that is
only checked against itself cannot notice the original moving.

    # segment are all rejected; empty/"." segments are dropped and the rest

    #
    # PLUS one stricter rule the write jail does not need but the read jail
    # does: a segment with a trailing space or dot is rejected outright,
    # rather than accepted and silently reinterpreted. The actual read path
    # for harness's declared read_files is RepoWorkspaceTools.read_file ->
    # ScopedRoots.read_bytes -> split_components, which raises on exactly
    # this (Windows silently strips trailing dots/spaces from a path
    # component, so "README.md." and "README.md" would open the same file).
    # Without this check, a path like "README.md." would validate here, get
    # staged and confirmed, and then _render_existing_files would catch the
    # reader's AgenticError and silently omit it -- the operator's confirmed
    # run would proceed without context they explicitly declared.
    #
    # Returns None rather than a "cleaned" string for rejectable inputs so
