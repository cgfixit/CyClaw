"""Ties utils/authn.py's primitives to utils/authn_store.py's tables.

Stage 2 of docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md: session creation/validation,
login/logout, and per-device bearer tokens. Mirrors utils/personality.py's
shape (a manager class opened once from cfg, holding a shared DB connection
behind a threading.Lock because it is used from FastAPI's threadpool).

``AuthManager`` itself has no HTTP awareness -- gate_auth.py is the only
caller that knows about cookies, headers, or status codes. That split keeps
this module testable without a running app, the same reason
utils/personality.py knows nothing about /soul's HTTP layer.
