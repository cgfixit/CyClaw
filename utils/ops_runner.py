"""utils/ops_runner.py – subprocess shim for the out-of-band ``sync`` / ``agentic`` CLIs.

The FastAPI gateway exposes ``POST /ops/sync`` and ``POST /ops/agentic`` so the
browser Soul Console can drive the two out-of-band subsystems. A browser cannot
spawn a subprocess, so the gateway must — but the gateway must NOT *import* those
packages, because architectural isolation of ``sync/`` and ``agentic/`` from
``gate.py`` / ``graph.py`` / ``mcp_hybrid_server.py`` is a hard CyClaw invariant.

This module is that boundary, and nothing more:

* It NEVER imports ``sync`` or ``agentic``. It only builds an argv list and runs
  it with ``subprocess.run([...])`` (list form, no shell) as
  ``python -m sync.cli`` / ``python -m agentic.cli``.
* It accepts only a whitelisted set of actions per subsystem. An unknown action
  raises :class:`OpsError`, which the route maps to HTTP 400 — a caller can never
  smuggle an arbitrary subcommand or flag through.
* User-supplied skill bodies are written to a ``NamedTemporaryFile`` and passed
  via ``--body-file``, never interpolated into argv.

Exit codes are translated to operator-meaningful labels (see the per-subsystem
maps below) so the UI can render failure states — a tripped ``--max-delete`` /
``--max-transfer`` safety fuse, an env/config error, or a refused write — without
re-deriving the meaning of each code.

Exit-code contract (mirrors the docstrings in ``sync/cli.py`` / ``agentic/cli.py``):

    sync:     0 ok · 10 ok+reindex-needed · 1 safety-abort · 2 failed · 3 env/config
    agentic:  0 ok · 2 failed · 3 env/config · 4 write-refused
