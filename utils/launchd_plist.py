"""Stdlib-only macOS launchd plist helpers, shared by every out-of-band
package (``sync``, ``agentic.fsconnect``, ``telegram``, ``harness``) that
generates a LaunchAgent plist from real, resolved install paths instead of a
hand-edited ``REPLACE_*`` template.

Never imported by ``gate.py``/``graph.py``/``mcp_hybrid_server.py`` (I6) --
those never touch launchd, and this module has no reason to reach them either
(pure stdlib: ``os``, ``plistlib``, ``shutil``, ``subprocess``, ``pathlib``).

Design contract every caller follows (see
``docs/work/MACOS_LAUNCHD_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md``):

  - Darwin-only. Callers gate on ``platform.system() == "Darwin"`` themselves
    -- this module has no opinion on platform and will happily write a plist
    anywhere if asked, so the caller's own guard is load-bearing.
  - Generate, don't auto-load. Nothing here ever calls ``launchctl
    load``/``bootstrap`` -- :func:`bootstrap_hint` returns the command an
    operator must run by hand.
  - No secrets in the file. Whether a generated plist's
    ``EnvironmentVariables`` (if any) stays secret-free is the caller's
    responsibility -- this module only writes/removes/probes whatever
    document dict it is given. Use :func:`wrap_with_keychain_secrets` to
    inject a runtime secret via the macOS Keychain instead of ever writing
    one into ``EnvironmentVariables``.

This module intentionally does NOT depend on ``sync.scheduler``'s
``LaunchdScheduler`` (and vice versa): both implement a small, similar
plist-write/bootout/probe pattern independently rather than sharing code
across the two, so each stays a self-contained, independently reviewable
change. See the PR that introduced this module for the reasoning.
