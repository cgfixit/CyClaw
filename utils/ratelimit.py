"""Thread-safe rate limiter with optional sqlite or Postgres persistence.

Extracted from ``gate.py`` so the limiter is a single importable unit shared
by the FastAPI gateway and its tests.

Persistence backends (all opt-in; in-memory stays the zero-config default):
  * ``db_url=None, db_path=None`` (default): pure in-memory (fast, resets on
    restart) — original behavior, untouched.
  * ``db_path="data/rate_limits.db"``: sqlite write-through; state survives
    restarts. Connection opened per write (cheap for a local file).
  * ``db_url="postgresql://…"``: Postgres write-through for multi-process /
    durable deployments. A SINGLE hardened connection is held for the limiter's
    lifetime (a TLS reconnect per request would dominate the hot path) and every
    access is serialized by the same ``threading.Lock`` as the in-memory map.

The gateway calls ``allow()`` from FastAPI's threadpool, so we keep the
threading.Lock for the hot path. When persistence is enabled we also write
through to the backend under the same lock (simple but correct).

Behavior preserved:
  * 60 requests / 60-second sliding window per client IP (configurable).
  * Idle-IP eviction.
  * Injectable clock for deterministic tests.
  * O(1) per-request persist (only the touched IP is written).

Note on scale-out: a Postgres round-trip per persisted request is heavier than a
local sqlite write. Persistence is opt-in for durability; for true multi-instance
rate limiting Redis (atomic counters + TTL) is the recommended target — not built
here. The Postgres backend exists for operators who already run Postgres for the
personality DB (see utils/personality_db.py) and want rate-limit state to survive
restarts too, without standing up Redis as a second dependency for that alone —
not for high-throughput multi-instance scale-out. See tests/test_ratelimit_postgres.py
(gated on CYCLAW_DB_URL, run by the postgres-backend CI job) for live coverage.

        A survivor is a candidate another writer refreshed after this instance
        took its snapshot: the conditional DELETE correctly matches zero rows
        for it. The caller must keep those in ``_hits``, because ``_hits`` is
        the only thing that can nominate a row for deletion -- evicting one
        whose row is still on disk means that if the refreshing instance exits,
        nothing here can ever nominate it again and it persists until restart.

        A candidate with no row at all is NOT a survivor: it is already gone,
        so the caller should drop it from memory as usual.

        Caller must hold ``self._lock``.

        ``ips`` comes from this instance's in-memory map, which is a snapshot
        taken when the instance was constructed. Several limiters can share one
        backend -- ``agentic/fsconnect/writer.py`` builds a per-root and a
        global limiter against the same file, separate processes can point at
        it too, and a rolling config change can put two DIFFERENT
        ``window_seconds`` values on the same backend simultaneously -- so
        "stale according to my snapshot" is not the same as "stale on disk",
        and "stale according to MY window" is not the same as "stale according
        to the policy that actually wrote this row".

        The delete is conditional on ``last_sweep + window_seconds <= now``,
        using the ROW's OWN persisted ``window_seconds`` (written by
        ``_persist`` under whichever instance most recently touched it) rather
        than this sweeping instance's. A row a long-window process just wrote
        therefore survives a short-window process's sweep even though it is
        already older than the short window -- it is evaluated against the
        policy that actually governs it, not the policy of whoever happens to
        run the next sweep. ``_ensure_window_seconds_column`` covers what a
        table predating this column does for rows it never wrote.

        The boundary is INCLUSIVE to match ``_sweep``, which calls a timestamp
        stale at ``now - t >= window_seconds``. With an exclusive ``<`` the two
        disagreed at exactly ``now - window_seconds``: ``_sweep`` dropped the IP
        from ``_hits`` while the DELETE spared the row, so nothing could ever
        nominate it again and it sat on disk forever -- reintroducing the
        unbounded growth this eviction exists to remove.

        A row whose ``window_seconds`` is not a positive number is NEVER
        deleted here -- its policy is unknown, and no time-based guess is
        safe: a fixed grace period was this method's second attempt (codex
        review on #1244, second round) and still failed, because a legacy
        writer's real configured window can be longer than ANY fixed
        constant this module could reasonably pick (third round) --
        ``RateLimiter`` imposes no ceiling on ``window_seconds``, so "pick a
        generous-enough number" is not a sound fix, only a bigger version of
        the same bug. An unknown-window row instead survives every sweep
        unconditionally until SOME instance persists a real (positive)
        ``window_seconds`` for it via ``_persist`` -- at which point it is
        governed by the per-row logic below like any other row. The cost is
        bounded, not unbounded: a row only enters the unknown state while an
        old (pre-migration) writer is actively touching it, and it only
        stays there for IPs that stop sending requests entirely during that
        same window -- a one-time, bounded debt from the coexistence period,
        not ongoing growth. ``_ensure_window_seconds_column`` covers what a
        table predating this column does for rows it never wrote.

        Known residual gap (both backends, not fixed here): a positive
        ``window_seconds`` is trusted at face value, but nothing here can
        tell "fresh, written by whoever is currently governing this row"
        apart from "stale, left over from an EARLIER writer's touch". Two
        concrete ways that happens, found across three review rounds:

        - Postgres only: ``ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`` overwrites only the
          columns it lists, so an old (pre-migration) writer's SET clause
          (timestamps, last_sweep -- see ``_upsert_sql``) leaves an EXISTING
          positive ``window_seconds`` untouched, even though it no longer
          reflects who is actually governing the row (e.g. an upgraded
          process creates a row first, an old process later refreshes it).
          SQLite does not share this specific path: its ``INSERT OR
          REPLACE`` resets ``window_seconds`` to 0 on ANY write from old
          code, correctly routing the row through the unknown-window path
          above instead.
        - Both backends: ``allow()``'s ``_stamped_ips`` set only guarantees
          THIS instance's own FIRST touch of an IP persists (closing the
          "never got to stamp its own policy" gap fixed above). It provides
          no ongoing guarantee once TWO OR MORE current-version instances
          with different ``window_seconds`` keep alternating writes to the
          same row: each instance's own bookkeeping only knows "have I
          EVER stamped this IP", not "is the row's CURRENT value still
          mine" -- so once instance A stamps, then instance B overwrites,
          instance A's own next touch still believes it already stamped
          and skips persisting again, leaving B's value in place even on
          A's subsequent (rejected) requests.

        Both are the same underlying problem: correctly telling "this
        column reflects the CURRENT governing policy" from "this column is
        stale, left by an earlier writer" needs a freshness signal this
        schema does not carry (e.g. a companion column recording which
        write last set ``window_seconds``, checked against ``last_sweep``).
        Accepted as a scoped limitation for this PR given CyClaw's
        single-operator threat model and the narrowness of triggering it
        (requires either an old/new-code coexistence window on Postgres, or
        two CURRENT-version instances with genuinely different configured
        windows actively alternating writes to the same IP) -- flagged
        explicitly, including this docstring's own update after each new
        review round found a sharper instance of it, rather than silently
        unaddressed or claimed fully solved.

        The delete is otherwise conditional on ``last_sweep + window_seconds
        <= now``, using the ROW's OWN persisted ``window_seconds`` (written
        by ``_persist`` under whichever instance most recently touched it)
        rather than this sweeping instance's. A row a long-window process
        just wrote therefore survives a short-window process's sweep even
        though it is already older than the short window -- it is evaluated
        against the policy that actually governs it, not the policy of
        whoever happens to run the next sweep.

        The boundary is INCLUSIVE to match ``_sweep``, which calls a timestamp
        stale at ``now - t >= window_seconds``. With an exclusive ``<`` the two
        disagreed at exactly ``now - window_seconds``: ``_sweep`` dropped the IP
        from ``_hits`` while the DELETE spared the row, so nothing could ever
        nominate it again and it sat on disk forever -- reintroducing the
        unbounded growth this eviction exists to remove.

        Both statements are written out in full rather than built from
        ``self._ph``: an f-string here would be flagged B608/S608 (as
        ``_upsert_sql`` already is) even though the interpolated text is only a
        placeholder run. Values are always bound as parameters.
