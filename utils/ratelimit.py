"""Thread-safe rate limiter with optional sqlite or Postgres persistence.

Extracted from ``gate.py`` so the limiter is a single importable unit shared
by the FastAPI gateway and its tests.

Persistence backends (all opt-in; in-memory stays the zero-config default):
  * ``db_url=None, db_path=None`` (default): pure in-memory (fast, resets on
    restart) — original behavior, untouched.
  * ``db_path="data/rate_limits.db"``: sqlite write-through; state survives
    restarts. Connection opened per write (cheap for a local file).
  * ``db_url="postgresql://…"``: Postgres write-through for multi-process /
    durable deployments. A SINGLE hardened connection is held for the limiter's
    lifetime (a TLS reconnect per request would dominate the hot path) and every
    access is serialized by the same ``threading.Lock`` as the in-memory map.

The gateway calls ``allow()`` from FastAPI's threadpool, so we keep the
threading.Lock for the hot path. When persistence is enabled we also write
through to the backend under the same lock (simple but correct).

Behavior preserved:
  * 60 requests / 60-second sliding window per client IP (configurable).
  * Idle-IP eviction.
  * Injectable clock for deterministic tests.
  * O(1) per-request persist (only the touched IP is written).

Note on scale-out: a Postgres round-trip per persisted request is heavier than a
local sqlite write. Persistence is opt-in for durability; for true multi-instance
rate limiting Redis (atomic counters + TTL) is the recommended target — not built
here. The Postgres backend exists for operators who already run Postgres for the
personality DB (see utils/personality_db.py) and want rate-limit state to survive
restarts too, without standing up Redis as a second dependency for that alone —
not for high-throughput multi-instance scale-out. See tests/test_ratelimit_postgres.py
(gated on CYCLAW_DB_URL, run by the postgres-backend CI job) for live coverage.
