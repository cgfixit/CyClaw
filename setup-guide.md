# CyClaw — GitHub Setup Guide (Windows · macOS · Linux)

**v1.9.0 | Offline-First | Ollama | ~15 min**
Verified 2026-07-29 against `main`; macOS path re-verified 2026-08-02.

This is the canonical setup guide (`docs/work/SETUP.md` and `docs/! How-To-Guides/setup-guide.md` redirect here). For the
full architecture tour — agentic layer, filesystem/SQL connectors, NeMo
Guardrails, Telegram channel design, and the security model — see
[`README.md`](README.md). This guide covers what's needed to get the core RAG
gateway running and how to exercise every REST endpoint from a terminal.

**On a Mac, go straight to [macOS (Apple Silicon)](#macos-apple-silicon)** —
the Linux block above it does not work here, for a reason spelled out in that
section. Then:
[running both servers](#running-both-servers-on-macos) ·
[testing every endpoint](#rest-api--testing-every-endpoint-from-the-terminal).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Git | Any recent version |
| Python 3.12 | Primary supported runtime (`requires-python >=3.12,<3.13` — 3.13 is excluded; numpy 1.26.x has no cp313 wheels) |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) | Running on `http://127.0.0.1:11434`, with `qwen3.8:27b-mlx` pulled: `ollama pull qwen3.8:27b-mlx` |
| Corpus `.md` files (optional) | The repo ships a small sample corpus in `data/corpus/`, so the indexer has something to build against out of the box. Copy your own `.md` files in to replace/extend it — from your own notes, or an existing SafeClaw/PsyClaw-style corpus if you have one. |
| Windows | PowerShell, no admin/elevation needed. If script execution is blocked, run once: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` |
| Linux | bash |
| macOS | **Apple Silicon (arm64) on macOS 14 Sonoma or newer**, bash or zsh. See [macOS](#macos-apple-silicon) — its torch step genuinely differs from Linux's, and an Intel Mac cannot satisfy the pinned torch build at all (why: [torch on macOS](#torch-on-macos-plain-build-no-cpu-suffix)) |

---

## Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1. Clone + venv
git clone https://github.com/CGFixIT/CyClaw.git
cd CyClaw
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Torch CPU first — order matters (keeps the CPU wheel, avoids a multi-GB
#    CUDA build, and stays on the patched side of CVE-2025-32434)
pip install torch==2.13.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 3. Runtime + test toolchain, pinned to the verified transitive tree
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt -c constraints.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML

# 4. Required env (any non-empty value works — see "GROK_API_KEY" below)
$env:GROK_API_KEY = "dummy"

# 5. Build the retrieval index (safe to skip for now — see "Is the index
#    really mandatory?" below — but /query 503s until you do this)
python -m retrieval.indexer

# 6. Run
uvicorn gate:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` → the terminal UI loads automatically.

### Windows smoke test

```powershell
.\.claude\skills\CyClaw-Sandbox\windows-smoke.ps1
```

Runs 22 real checks — 6 against the gateway (`/health`, an on-topic query, an offline-confirmation
gate check, an injection-blocked query, `/soul`, the terminal page) with
explicit pass/fail output and a non-zero exit on any failure. For a single
quick manual check instead, `tests\apipsTest.ps1` fires one `POST /query` and
prints the raw response — useful for eyeballing a response shape, not a
pass/fail test.

---

## Linux (Bash)

```bash
# 1. Clone + venv
git clone https://github.com/CGFixIT/CyClaw.git && cd CyClaw
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Torch CPU first — order matters (see the Windows step 2 note above)
pip install torch==2.13.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 3. Runtime + test toolchain, pinned to the verified transitive tree
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt -c constraints.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML

# 4. Required env (any non-empty value works — see "GROK_API_KEY" below)
export GROK_API_KEY=dummy

# 5. Build the retrieval index (see "Is the index really mandatory?" below)
python -m retrieval.indexer

# 6. Run
uvicorn gate:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

### Linux smoke test

Against already-running servers (same 22-check contract as the Windows
script). POSIX/bash 3.2; curl + python3 only:

```bash
export CYCLAW_API_KEY="the-value-you-generated"
bash .claude/skills/CyClaw-Sandbox/macos-smoke.sh
```

`macos-smoke.sh` is Darwin-first but the HTTP surface is OS-agnostic, so
Linux operators use the same file. For a one-line readiness check instead:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```


---

## macOS (Apple Silicon)

**Do not follow the Linux block above verbatim on macOS.** Its step 2 fails
here, and step 3 then fails a second time for a related reason. Both are
explained under [torch on macOS](#torch-on-macos-plain-build-no-cpu-suffix);
the short version is that the `+cpu` wheel Linux and Windows install does not
exist for macOS, and both `requirements.txt` and `constraints.txt` hardcode
that `+cpu` pin.

Three ways to do this. **Option C** is the recommended one-shot after
`git clone` (install + keys + Ollama + index + both servers). **Option A**
is the installer only if you already have keys/Ollama handled. **Option B**
is the by-hand core-RAG install.

### Option C — one-shot after clone (recommended)

`macos/setup-from-clone.sh` is the operator-facing "I just cloned this,
make it run" path on Apple Silicon. It does **not** reimplement the
installer or the key bootstrap — it chains them and fills the four holes
Option A leaves open (Ollama, the retrieval index, API keys, starting
both servers).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CGFixIT/CyClaw.git && cd CyClaw
bash ./macos/setup-from-clone.sh
```

It will:

1. Run cyclaw-advisor `verify.sh` (checkout posture — dep-file presence).
   It does **not** run `bootstrap.sh` (that skill harness git-fetches
   `origin/main`).
2. `brew analytics off` if Homebrew is already on PATH
3. Require Python 3.12.x (offer `brew install python@3.12` if missing)
4. Run `macos/install-cyclaw.sh --repo-path <this checkout>`
5. Run `macos/setup-cyclaw-keys.sh` — autogenerates `CYCLAW_API_KEY`
   (`openssl rand -hex 20`), then prompts (skip allowed) for Telegram,
   Claude (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — that is the only name `llm/client.py`
   reads), Grok, and GitHub. Secrets go to Keychain + `~/.CyClaw/.env`
   (`chmod 600`). They are never written to `config.yaml`, never inlined
   into an rc file, and never placed on a child-process argv.
6. Optionally `gh auth login --with-token` from stdin if `GH_TOKEN` was
   stored (never `--token "$GH_TOKEN"`)
7. Check Ollama; prefer the signed `.app` (will not `curl | sh` unless
   you pass `--ollama-install-script`); pull the shipped local model
   (`qwen3.8:27b-mlx`, or `--small-model` for `qwen2.5:7b`)
8. Build the retrieval index (`python -m retrieval.indexer`)
9. `exec macos/invoke-cyclaw.sh --repo <this checkout>` so the
   terminal (`:8787`) starts and Ctrl+C owns the process tree

Useful flags: `--dry-run`, `--skip-prompts`, `--no-start`, `--small-model`,
`--ollama-model TAG`, `--grok-dummy`, `--skip-install`, `--skip-keys`,
`--skip-ollama`, `--skip-index`, `--no-browser`, `--no-fsconnect`.

What it still will **not** do (deliberate, same contract as the rest of
`macos/`): enable fsconnect writes or indexing, generate or load
LaunchAgents (those need `--confirm --reason`), flip `app.mode` or
`models.*.enabled`, `nltk.download()`, or inline a secret into an rc file.

If `--small-model` (or `--ollama-model`) pulls a tag other than the
shipped `models.local_llm.model`, you must update **both**
`models.local_llm.model` and `guardrails.model` in `config.yaml` or
`/query` will 404 against Ollama (config-guard C11). The script warns;
it does not edit `config.yaml`.

### Option A — the installer script (handles the torch difference for you)

`macos/install-cyclaw.sh` already branches on `uname -s` = `Darwin` and does
the right thing (`macos/install-cyclaw.sh:176-190`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CGFixIT/CyClaw.git && cd CyClaw
bash ./macos/install-cyclaw.sh
```

It finds a Python 3.12.x — an existing `~/.CyClaw/venv` on any other version is refused, not replaced — creates `~/.CyClaw/venv`, installs the correct torch
build, installs the rest from corrected manifests, writes a `cyclaw` shim, and
adds a PATH entry plus a `cyclaw()` function to your rc file (`~/.zshrc` on
zsh; on macOS bash it preserves the first existing login file among
`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, and `~/.profile`, creating
`~/.bash_profile` only when none exists). Useful flags:
`--repo-path ~/src/CyClaw` (use an existing clone), `--replace-repo`,
`--skip-python-deps`, `--no-profile-edit`, `--no-path-edit`.
`--replace-repo` permits deleting only an unusable directory at the default
`~/.CyClaw/repo` clone target before cloning; it is intentionally destructive
and does not apply with `--repo-path`. Uninstall with
`bash ./macos/uninstall-cyclaw.sh` (`--remove-home` also deletes `~/.CyClaw`,
with a prompt; `--remove-keychain` is the opt-in purge of the five
documented Keychain services — see
[401 / key drift recovery](macos/README.md#401--key-drift-recovery)).

**What it deliberately does NOT do** — verified against the script, which
contains zero references to any of these. Option A is not a superset of
Option B; it is a different target:

| Not handled | You still need to |
|---|---|
| Ollama install / `ollama serve` / model pull | Do [Ollama on macOS](#ollama-on-macos) yourself |
| The retrieval index | Run `python -m retrieval.indexer` — otherwise `/query` 503s |
| `CYCLAW_API_KEY` | Export it before launching, or the console's state-changing routes fail closed with 401. `macos/invoke-cyclaw.sh:165-166` warns about this at launch; the key is deliberately never written into the shim, since that would put a secret in a profile file on disk |
| `GROK_API_KEY` | Export it (any non-empty value offline) |
| Your own corpus | Copy `.md` files into `data/corpus/` |

It also installs its venv at `~/.CyClaw/venv`, **not** into your clone's
`.venv` — so after Option A you still have no environment in the clone itself.
**If you want the gateway from a fresh clone in one step, use Option C.**
Option A alone still needs Ollama, the index, and keys (table above).
Option B is the by-hand core-RAG path.


### Option B — by hand, step by step

```bash
# 0. Prerequisites.
#    Python 3.12.x exactly — 3.13 is not supported:
#      brew install python@3.12
#    or the official installer: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
#    Ollama — see "Ollama on macOS" below; needed before step 6, not before 1.
#
#    Confirm you are on Apple Silicon (must print "arm64" — an Intel Mac
#    cannot install this repo's pinned torch at all; see "torch on macOS"):
uname -m
#    Confirm macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer — the only macOS torch wheels published
#    at this pin are tagged macosx_14_0, which is a floor, not a preference:
sw_vers -productVersion

# 1. Clone + venv
git clone https://github.com/CGFixIT/CyClaw.git && cd CyClaw
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Torch FIRST, and PLAIN — no "+cpu" suffix, no --index-url override.
#    Apple Silicon has no separate CPU/CUDA build to disambiguate, so PyPI
#    ships a single arm64 wheel. This is the step the Linux block gets wrong
#    for macOS.
pip install "torch==2.13.0"

# 3. Everything else — but from a requirements.txt copy with the torch and
#    PyTorch-index lines removed, and a constraints.txt copy with only the
#    "+cpu" suffix dropped from the torch pin. Without the first, pip tries
#    to reconcile the plain torch you just installed against the "+cpu" pin
#    and the install fails; without the second, --ignore-installed (which
#    reinstalls every package, not just PyYAML) floats torch to PyPI's
#    newest release. Mirrors what CI's macos-latest leg runs.
grep -v -e '^torch==' -e '^--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org' \
    requirements.txt > /tmp/requirements-macos.txt
sed 's/^\(torch==[0-9][0-9.]*\)+cpu$/\1/' constraints.txt > /tmp/constraints-macos.txt
pip install -r /tmp/requirements-macos.txt -r requirements-test.txt -c /tmp/constraints-macos.txt \
    --ignore-installed PyYAML

# 4. Required env (any non-empty value works — see "GROK_API_KEY" below)
export GROK_API_KEY=dummy

# 4b. API key for the Soul + operator consoles. /query, /health and the
#     terminal UI need no key, but every /soul/* and /ops/* route fails CLOSED
#     with 401 without one — see "CYCLAW_API_KEY" below. Generate a real value
#     rather than typing a word: openssl ships with macOS, no install needed.
export CYCLAW_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
echo "$CYCLAW_API_KEY"          # copy this — you paste it into the console UI

# 5. Build the retrieval index (see "Is the index really mandatory?" below)
python -m retrieval.indexer

# 6. Run
uvicorn gate:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` → the terminal UI loads automatically.

`export` lasts only for that Terminal tab. **Do not paste secrets into
`~/.zshrc`.** The preferred persist path is
[`macos/setup-cyclaw-keys.sh`](macos/setup-cyclaw-keys.sh):

```bash
bash macos/setup-cyclaw-keys.sh
source ~/.CyClaw/.env          # this tab; new tabs inherit via the rc source block
```

That generates `CYCLAW_API_KEY` (`openssl rand -hex 20`), prompts for Telegram /
Claude (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) / Grok / GitHub (skip any), and stores them in the
macOS Keychain plus `~/.CyClaw/.env` (`chmod 600`). The rc file only *sources*
that dotenv — it never inlines a secret. LaunchAgents still read Keychain via
`cyclaw-keychain-env.sh`. Flags and service names: [`macos/README.md`](macos/README.md).
A rotate does not change a running server; if soul routes 401 after
a key change, follow
[401 / key drift recovery](macos/README.md#401--key-drift-recovery)
(`--restart-servers`, new shell, `--fill-browser` / paste; `--remove-keychain`
to delete leftover items).

If you only need the keys in the current tab and do not want the bootstrap:

```bash
export GROK_API_KEY=dummy
export CYCLAW_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
```

### Running both servers on macOS

CyClaw ships **two** independent local web apps. They are separate processes on
separate ports; neither needs the other, and running one does not start the
other.

```bash
# 1) The RAG gateway — serves static/terminal.html at /, plus the whole REST API
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn gate:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
#    → http://127.0.0.1:8787

```

**The `cyclaw-*` short names need a self-install.** `cyclaw-server`,
`cyclaw-index`, `cyclaw-mcp`, `cyclaw-metrics`, `cyclaw-clear-cache`,
`cyclaw-user`, and `cyclaw-gen-cert` are `[project.scripts]` console scripts,
and pip writes those shims into the venv only when the CyClaw *project itself*
is installed (`pip install -e .`). The install above installs
`requirements.txt`, a third-party pin list with no self-install line, so after
following this guide exactly they are `command not found`. Every `python -m …`
form in this guide is chosen because it needs no self-install; add
`pip install -e . -c constraints.txt` after step 3 if you want the short names.

Add `--reload` to the `uvicorn gate:app` line while editing code; leave it off
otherwise (it doubles the process count and re-imports the whole retrieval
stack on every save).

### Ollama on macOS

Same prerequisite as every platform, installed differently. Do this **before**
step 6 above — `uvicorn` will start without it, but `/query` needs a model
behind it.

Preferred: download the signed `.app` from
[ollama.com/download/mac](https://ollama.com/download/mac) and launch it. The
`curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh` one-liner in
[`docs/! How-To-Guides/OLLAMA_SETUP.md`](docs/!%20How-To-Guides/OLLAMA_SETUP.md)
also documents the one-liner, but it is a pipe-to-shell —
prefer the signed app on a machine you care about.

```bash
ollama --version            # sanity check
ollama serve                # only if you did NOT install the .app — see below
ollama pull qwen3.8:27b-mlx     # the model config.yaml expects by default (dense
                            # ~27B — multi-GB pull). Want a lighter one? See
                            # "Running a different local model" below.

# Ollama's own native API — confirms the daemon is up and lists pulled models:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags

# The OpenAI-compatible endpoint CyClaw actually talks to
# (config.yaml -> models.local_llm.base_url) is a DIFFERENT path on the same port:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/models
```

The `.app` runs `ollama serve` for you, so a separate `ollama serve` will fail
with an address-already-in-use error — that is the app already doing its job,
not a problem to fix.

### macOS smoke test

Darwin twin of `windows-smoke.ps1`. Same checks against the gateway,
same non-zero exit on any failure, bash 3.2 / BSD userland, no jq and no
Homebrew. The server must already be running (`invoke-cyclaw.sh` or the
uvicorn line above):

```bash
export CYCLAW_API_KEY="the-value-you-generated"
bash .claude/skills/CyClaw-Sandbox/macos-smoke.sh
```

For a one-line readiness check instead:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

The full pytest suite remains the install gate:

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
```


---

## REST API — testing every endpoint from the Terminal

Every route below is on the RAG gateway (`127.0.0.1:8787`). `curl` and
`python3` both ship with macOS; nothing extra to install. Pipe anything
through `python3 -m json.tool` to pretty-print it.

Export the key once per tab so the authenticated examples work as written:

```bash
export CYCLAW_API_KEY="the-value-you-generated"
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $CYCLAW_API_KEY"
```

### Open routes (no key)

| Route | Method | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | serves `static/terminal.html` — the browser console |
| `/static/*` | GET | static assets for that page |
| `/health` | GET | readiness: `status` (`ok`/`degraded` — never "healthy"), per-service status, `index_ready`, `graph_ready`, `mode`, `version`, `corpus_path`, and the `graph_timeout_sec` / `ops_sync_timeout_sec` budgets the console uses to bound its own fetches |
| `/query` | POST | the RAG request path — rate-limited (60/min per IP), sanitized. **Same-origin always:** a cross-site `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` is refused `403 CROSS_SITE_BLOCKED` regardless of `auth.enabled`, while a request carrying neither header is allowed (curl, MCP). When `auth.enabled` is true, also requires a session cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <device-token>`, and the `audit` role is refused `403 AUTH_ROLE_DENIED` |
| `/index/build` | POST | first-run: build the search index from `corpus.path`. Loopback peer + same-origin only; 409 while a build is running |
| `/index/status` | GET | progress of the current or last build — always 200 |

```bash
# Readiness. "degraded" without Ollama running is NORMAL, not an error.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health | python3 -m json.tool

# A normal query.
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"What is RRF fusion?"}' | python3 -m json.tool

# First run only: no index yet. /query answers 503 INDEX_NOT_FOUND until one
# exists. Build it from the browser console's "Build my library" button, or:
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/index/build | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/index/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

If the corpus does not answer it, the response comes back with
`needs_confirm: true` and a `confirm_message` instead of an answer. Re-POST the
same query with your decision — this is the user gate, and it is the only way
an external provider is ever reached:

```bash
# Decline escalation → a local best-effort answer
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"Who won the 2026 World Cup?","user_confirmed_online":false}'

# Confirm escalation, naming the provider. Still requires app.mode: "hybrid"
# AND that provider enabled in config.yaml AND its key env var set — all three,
# or it silently answers offline instead.
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"Who won the 2026 World Cup?","user_confirmed_online":true,"online_provider":"grok"}'
```

`online_provider` accepts only `"grok"` or `"claude"`. The request model is
`extra='forbid'`, so a typo'd field name returns `422`, not a silent ignore.

### Authentication routes (`/auth/*`, off by default)

Per-user authentication (`docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md`), separate from the
single shared `CYCLAW_API_KEY` above. Ships `auth.enabled: false` in
`config.yaml` — every `/auth/*` route below returns `503` until you turn it on.
When it is on, `POST /query` also requires the session cookie or a named
device token (the console login form, or `cyclaw-user token create`).
`/health` stays open. The shared `CYCLAW_API_KEY` still gates `/soul/*` and
`/ops/*`.

| Route | Method | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/auth/setup-status` | GET | unauthenticated, rate-limited; `{enabled, needs_password, username}` while the bootstrap admin still has no password; 503 when `auth.enabled` is false |
| `/auth/bootstrap-password` | POST | first admin password; loopback peer + same-origin only, no reverse-proxy forwarding headers; 403 off-box or when proxied; 409 once set; 503 when auth off |
| `/auth/login` | POST | `{"username", "password"}` → sets an `HttpOnly` session cookie and returns a CSRF token |
| `/auth/logout` | POST | requires the session cookie **and** the CSRF token in an `X-CyClaw-CSRF` header; revokes the session |
| `/auth/whoami` | GET | returns the current username **and role** (plus a freshly rotated `csrf_token` on the session-cookie path), via either the session cookie or an `Authorization: Bearer <device-token>` header |
| `/auth/users` | GET | list users (no password hashes); session **or bearer device token**, `admin` or `operator` role |
| `/auth/users` | POST | create a user; session+CSRF or an admin bearer token; `operator` cannot create an `admin` |
| `/auth/password` | POST | self-service password change for the caller's own account; **session + CSRF (any role), or an admin bearer token** — a non-admin device token is refused 403 |
| `/auth/users/{username}/password` | POST | reset another user's password; session+CSRF or admin bearer; `operator` cannot touch `admin` accounts |
| `/auth/users/{username}/role` | POST | set a user's role; admin only |
| `/auth/users/{username}/disable` | POST | disable a user; admin, or operator on non-admins |
| `/auth/users/{username}/enable` | POST | re-enable a user; admin, or operator on non-admins |
| `/auth/users/{username}` | DELETE | hard delete a user (after revoking their sessions/tokens); admin only |
| `/auth/audit/summary` | GET | reduced audit view; session **or bearer device token**, `admin` or `audit` role — not the `CYCLAW_API_KEY` ops view |

Three roles exist: `admin` (full access), `operator` (manage non-admin users,
no delete/set-role), and `audit` (`/auth/audit/summary` only, `/query`
denied). The last enabled `admin` account is protected — disable/delete/
role-change on it is refused. See `docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md` §12 for the
full role matrix.

Turning `auth.enabled` on for the first time with no existing accounts
creates one — username `admin`, with **no usable password**: the account is
seeded with the hash of a random secret that is discarded immediately, so
nothing is ever printed, logged, or stored in plaintext. Set the first real
password on the server machine itself (prompts via `getpass`, no echo):

```bash
cyclaw-user passwd admin
```

The browser first-run panel can also `POST /auth/bootstrap-password` from
loopback (same-origin); off-box callers get 403. After the password exists
that route returns 409 — use `cyclaw-user passwd` or `/auth/password`.

Manage accounts after that with the same local-only `cyclaw-user` CLI (which also has a `role` subcommand)
(`add`/`list`/`disable`/`enable`/`passwd`/`token create`/`token list`/
`token revoke`) — it never runs over HTTP.

### TLS (`api.tls`, off by default)

When `api.tls.enabled` is the literal boolean `true`, `cyclaw-server` /
`python gate.py` listen with HTTPS using `api.tls.certfile` and
`api.tls.keyfile`. Missing files refuse to start. Generate a self-signed
cert that includes hostname + LAN IPs in `subjectAltName`:

```bash
cyclaw-gen-cert
# writes data/tls/cert.pem and data/tls/key.pem
```

Leave `enabled: false` until those files exist. The Docker `CMD` does not
go through `_serve` and is not covered by this wiring. The console CSP
`connect-src` stays `'self'` (same-origin HTTPS is already `'self'`).
`security.allowed_origins` includes `https://` twins of the loopback/LAN
http entries.

### Authenticated routes (Bearer `CYCLAW_API_KEY`)

All of these return `401` when the key is missing **or** when `CYCLAW_API_KEY`
is unset on the server — fail-closed in both directions, **with the shipped
`security.api_key_optional: false`** (`config.yaml`). Setting that flag true is the
one deliberate bypass: `gate.py`'s `_api_key_bypass_allowed` then skips the key, but
only for a request that is simultaneously from a loopback socket peer, carries no
reverse-proxy forwarding header, and is not cross-site. A remote caller always needs
the real key.

| Route | Method | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/soul` | GET | current soul text + version metadata |
| `/soul/propose` | POST | advisory injection scan of a proposed soul — never writes |
| `/soul/apply` | POST | enforced scan + atomic write; **requires a `reason`** |
| `/soul/reload` | POST | re-read `soul.md` from disk |
| `/soul/restore` | POST | restore from the `.bak` copy |
| `/audit/summary` | GET | aggregate audit stats only — never raw query text |
| `/ops/sync` | POST | Dropbox corpus sync shim |
| `/ops/agentic` | POST | agentic-layer shim |
| `/ops/fsconnect` | POST | filesystem-connector shim |
| `/ops/sqlconnect` | POST | SQL-connector shim |
| `/memory/status` | GET | memory flags + counts (200 even when off) |
| `/memory/facts` | GET | list active facts (404 if master off) |
| `/memory/episodes` | GET | list staged episodes (404 if master off) |
| `/memory/proposals` | GET | list proposals (404 if propose/apply off) |
| `/memory/propose` | POST | stage a fact mutation; **requires a `reason`** |
| `/memory/apply` | POST | apply a pending proposal; reason + injection scan |
| `/memory/reject` | POST | reject a pending proposal; **requires a `reason`** |
| `/query/export/html` | GET | offline HTML dump of episodes/facts (404 if export off) |

Memory routes ship **default-off** (`memory.enabled: false` in `config.yaml`).
See `docs/memory/README.md` for progressive enablement. `/memory/status` is the
safe probe; propose/apply mutate the facts store and need a non-empty `reason`.

```bash
curl -s -H "$AUTH" http://127.0.0.1:8787/soul | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "$AUTH" http://127.0.0.1:8787/audit/summary | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s -H "$AUTH" http://127.0.0.1:8787/memory/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Dry-run a soul change — scans and reports, writes nothing.
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/soul/propose \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"new_soul":"# Soul\n\nBe concise.","reason":"testing the scanner"}'

# Operator consoles. "status" is the read-only action on each; every one of the
# four takes an `action` field and nothing else is required.
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/ops/sync \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action":"status"}'
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/ops/agentic \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action":"status"}'
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/ops/fsconnect \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action":"status"}'
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/ops/sqlconnect \
  -H "$AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action":"status"}'
```

**Four of these mutate state. Do not treat any of them as a probe.**

| Route | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `POST /soul/apply` | rewrites `soul.md`, rotates the old copy to `.bak`, records a version row. Requires a non-empty `reason` — an architectural invariant, not a validation nicety, so there is no flag to skip it |
| `POST /soul/restore` | **also rewrites `soul.md`**, from the `.bak`. It reaches the same atomic write path with a hardcoded reason and `scan=False`, so it skips the injection scan `/soul/apply` enforces. Firing it "just to see" silently replaces your live soul with stale backup content |
| `POST /ops/sync` | with `action: "sync"` this is a **real rclone corpus transfer**. Only `"dry_run": true` makes it read-only; `action: "status"` is the safe probe |
| `POST /ops/agentic` | with `action: "apply-skill"` this writes a skill file. `action: "status"` is the safe probe |

Every other route above, and the `"status"` action on all four `/ops/*`
endpoints, is read-only.

### Reading the status codes

| Code | Means |
|---|---|
| `200` | success — including a `needs_confirm: true` gate response, which is not an error |
| `400` | your `Host` header is not in `config.yaml`'s `allowed_hosts`, or the injection filter rejected the query |
| `401` | missing/invalid `CYCLAW_API_KEY` (or it is unset server-side) |
| `404` | on a `/soul/*` route: `personality.enabled` is `false` in `config.yaml` |
| `403` | cross-site request (`CROSS_SITE_BLOCKED`), a non-loopback caller on `/index/build` or `/auth/bootstrap-password`, a missing/invalid CSRF token, or an RBAC denial (`AUTH_ROLE_DENIED`) |
| `409` | an index build is already running (`INDEX_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS`), or the first admin password is already set |
| `422` | request body failed Pydantic validation — usually a misspelled field, since the models forbid extras |
| `423` | `/auth/login` only: account temporarily locked from too many failed attempts — `retry_after_sec` under `detail.details` in the response body |
| `429` | rate limit — 60 requests/min per IP |
| `503` | `INDEX_NOT_FOUND` — run `python -m retrieval.indexer` |
| `504` | the graph exceeded `api.graph_timeout_sec` (780s) |

## Key Notes

### torch on macOS: plain build, no `+cpu` suffix

The single most common way a macOS install fails here, and the reason macOS
gets its own section above rather than sharing Linux's.

`requirements.txt` and `constraints.txt` both hardcode `torch==2.13.0+cpu`
against `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`. That `+cpu` local-version
suffix exists on Linux and Windows specifically to avoid pip resolving the
default CUDA-bundled wheel. **Apple Silicon has no CUDA build to disambiguate
from, so no `+cpu`-suffixed macOS wheel is published at all** — that index
404s for macOS, confirmed on this repo's first `macos-latest` CI run
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml:641-655`).

Verified against PyPI, 2026-08-02: `torch==2.13.0` publishes exactly six macOS
wheels, and every one of them is `macosx_14_0_arm64`
(`torch-2.13.0-cp312-cp312-macosx_14_0_arm64.whl` is the Python 3.12 one).
Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) is the floor.** The `macosx_14_0` platform tag is a
  minimum, not a preference — macOS 13 and earlier cannot install this wheel.
- **Intel Macs are not supported at this pin.** There is no `x86_64` macOS
  wheel for torch 2.13.0 on PyPI, so an Intel Mac cannot satisfy the pinned
  build. Running CyClaw's core RAG gateway there needs a different torch pin
  than the one this repo ships, which is outside what this guide covers.

Three places in the repo already implement the correct macOS behavior and
agree with each other — the CI lane (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:641-659`), the
installer (`macos/install-cyclaw.sh:124-137`), and
[`macos/README.md`](macos/README.md). The by-hand steps in the
macOS section above are those same commands.

### Running a different local model

`config.yaml` ships `models.local_llm.model: "qwen3.8:27b-mlx"` — a dense ~27B
model — and the setup steps pull exactly that. It is the heaviest default this
project has shipped: expect a multi-gigabyte pull and meaningful RAM use. On
modest hardware a smaller tag (`qwen2.5:7b`, `mistral:7b`) is a perfectly
supported swap. Either direction, two things must move together, or CyClaw
hangs instead of failing loudly:

1. **The tag must match what you actually pulled, in _two_ config keys.**
   `models.local_llm.model` **and** `guardrails.model` are both passed through
   to Ollama, and `config-guard`'s C11 check **warns** if they drift (it only fails under `--strict`, and the `verify-skills` lane that runs it is `continue-on-error`, so nothing blocks a merge on it) when they drift
   apart. A tag mismatch against Ollama is an `Ollama HTTP 404`. Tags are
   case-sensitive — use exactly what `ollama list` prints.
2. **Ollama's context length must have headroom**, or generation stalls at
   `0% processing` rather than erroring. The formula (from `config.yaml`'s own
   comment) is:

   ```
   num_ctx  >=  retrieval.max_context_tokens + local_llm.max_tokens + ~1500
   ```

   At the shipped `8000 + 4096 + 1500` the floor is **13,596**; the shipped
   recommendation stays **16,384** (~2.8k tokens spare). Set it server-wide
   *before* starting Ollama — `num_ctx` is not a CLI flag:

   ```bash
   export OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384
   ollama serve
   ```

This is the single most common "CyClaw hangs" cause, and it is *more* likely on
a large model, not less — a bigger model does not raise `num_ctx` for you.
Full detail, including the per-session `/set parameter num_ctx` alternative:
[`docs/! How-To-Guides/OLLAMA_SETUP.md`](docs/!%20How-To-Guides/OLLAMA_SETUP.md).

**Driving `agentic/real_repo_loop.py`** (`real-repo-run`/`real-repo-run-plan`)
against the same Ollama instance
needs more headroom than the formula above — that pathway's per-iteration
prompt can legitimately run several times larger. See
[`OLLAMA_SETUP.md`'s agentic context guidance](docs/!%20How-To-Guides/OLLAMA_SETUP.md#the-agentic-real-repo-coding-loop-needs-more-headroom-than-that).

The shipped `local_llm.timeout_sec: 720` and `max_tokens: 4096` are sized for a
dense ~27B MLX model on M5 Pro class Apple Silicon (see `CLAUDE.md`'s
load-bearing-numbers table). Measure actual tok/s on the machine with
`python3 scripts/measure_local_llm_throughput.py` rather than trusting
third-party figures; MLX quant tunings live in `macos/ollama-mlx.env`.
`timeout_sec` must stay
below `api.graph_timeout_sec` (780) if you do raise it. Dropping to a smaller
model needs no config change beyond the two `model:` keys; the generous timeout
simply goes unused.

### Is the index really mandatory?

`gate.py` is fail-soft: it boots and serves `/health` even with no index
built. Only `POST /query` returns `503 {"code": "INDEX_NOT_FOUND"}` until you
run `python -m retrieval.indexer` at least once. Run it before you actually
try to query CyClaw, not necessarily before every server start — and note
`index/` is never checked into git, so this step is needed in every fresh
clone and every fresh environment, not just the first one you ever set up.

### GROK_API_KEY in offline mode and tests

A dummy value is fine when you explicitly set `app.mode: "offline"`, and for
the test command below. The key is read lazily at an actual Grok call site
(`llm/client.py`), which never fires in offline mode. The shipped config is
`app.mode: "hybrid"`; it still cannot call Grok without the provider gate,
per-request confirmation, and a usable real key. `security.require_env` in
`config.yaml` is descriptive; no code enforces it. Tests specifically require
`GROK_API_KEY=dummy` (or any non-empty value) to be set.

### CYCLAW_API_KEY — required for the Soul console, not for `/query`

`/query`, `/health`, and the terminal UI itself need no key. But
`/soul`, `/soul/propose`, `/soul/apply`, `/soul/reload`, and `/soul/restore`
— along with the `/ops/sync`, `/ops/agentic`, `/ops/fsconnect`, and
`/ops/sqlconnect` operator consoles — all require a Bearer `CYCLAW_API_KEY`
and fail **closed** (401) if it's unset. This is easy to miss because the
terminal UI itself loads with no key at all; you'll only hit it when you try
to use one of those consoles. See README's
[API Key Setup](README.md#api-key-setup-soul-mutations) section for the full
per-platform (PowerShell / cmd / bash / systemd / `.env`) instructions.

### No NLTK data download needed

`nltk` is a pinned dependency, but only for its Porter stemmer (pure code, no
downloaded corpus). Tokenization uses a plain word-regex —
`retrieval/stemmer.py` deliberately never calls `nltk.data.load()` /
`word_tokenize()`, so the punkt tokenizer's own path-traversal CVE is never
reachable. There is no `nltk.download()` step to run, and running one adds
network egress this project otherwise avoids for no benefit.

### Telemetry

Every maintained CyClaw Python chokepoint — the gateway, the MCP server, the
metrics/indexer/vector-store/cache CLIs, the auth/cert
CLIs, and the sync/agentic/guardrails/telegram/opentweet packages — applies a
shared telemetry-kill block (`utils/telemetry_kill.py`) before any SDK
import; the same canonical values are also delivered as literal environment
before the interpreter starts by the Docker image, the shipped launchers, and
every generated launchd plist / Windows task / cron line. LangChain/LangSmith
tracing, ChromaDB's OpenTelemetry and PostHog paths, NeMo Guardrails' usage
stats, HuggingFace Hub's telemetry ping, ONNX Runtime (env before import plus
the `disable_telemetry_events()` API at its load seams), GitHub CLI and
PowerShell host telemetry, and the generic OpenTelemetry SDK are all disabled
unconditionally, with no manual step needed. Ancillary *update checks* (gh,
PowerShell, pip, the hf CLI, Homebrew) are opted out too, but tracked as a
separate class — a version check is egress, not telemetry. None of this is a
network kill switch: CyClaw's intentional egress (cloud fallbacks, channels,
sync) is governed by its own gates, classified in SECURITY.md.
`HF_HUB_OFFLINE`/`TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` are the one deliberate exception:
CyClaw sets those two itself, but only once it has confirmed the embedding
model is already cached on disk, so a brand-new install can still complete
its one-time model download. See
`docs/security-philosophy/cyclaw_telemetry_kill.env` for the full reference
list if you want to source it by hand for a locked-down deployment (it uses
`export` lines, so children of your shell really inherit it).

One subsystem deserves its own sentence because it ships **on**: the Numbat
projection writes a local NDJSON stream (`logs/numbat-events.ndjsonl`) whose
every event carries hostname/username/uid endpoint metadata — a second
sensitive *local* log, not telemetry (file sink only, no HTTP anywhere).
Disable it with `numbat.enabled: false` in `config.yaml`; it never belongs in
the env kill map.

**Homebrew (macOS) is not covered by any of the above, and is on by default.**
Homebrew reports its own install and usage counts, independently of CyClaw —
CyClaw cannot disable it, because CyClaw never launches `brew` (the installer
declares no Homebrew dependency at all) and the kill block only reaches
programs CyClaw itself spawns. If you installed Python or anything else with
Homebrew, opt out once, per machine:

```bash
brew analytics off      # persistent; writes a config file, survives new shells
```

`HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1` is the env-var equivalent and is listed in the
reference `.env` above, so sourcing that file also covers it for that shell.
Verify with `brew analytics state`. See
[Homebrew's analytics docs](https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics).

### Test gate

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ -q --tb=short
```

is the install-correctness gate. A bare `pytest` run like this does **not**
measure coverage (`pyproject.toml`'s `addopts` has no `--cov=`); the 80%
coverage gate only applies under CI's explicit `--cov=` invocation. Any
failure here is a real defect against your environment, not an expected
placeholder — there are no known-failing tests on a clean install.

### constraints.txt

The `-c constraints.txt` flag pins the full transitive dependency tree for a
reproducible install; it's a normal, permanent, actively-maintained part of
the repo (not a recovery step). If it's ever missing, `git pull` restores it;
`pip install -r requirements.txt` alone still works without it, just without
the transitive-pin guarantee.

## config.yaml — Key Settings to Verify

```yaml
app:
  mode: "hybrid"                           # shipped value; external calls still need provider enablement + per-query confirmation + a real key

models:
  local_llm:
    provider: "ollama"
    base_url: "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"  # Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint — do not change
    model: "qwen3.8:27b-mlx"                     # must match a model tag actually pulled in Ollama
    timeout_sec: 720                        # must stay < api.graph_timeout_sec (780)
    max_tokens: 4096                        # reserved output budget — see config.yaml's own comment on num_ctx headroom

retrieval:
  min_score: 0.028     # RRF fused-rank threshold (NOT cosine similarity — a different scale)
  top_k_semantic: 5
  top_k_keyword: 5
  rrf_k: 60

personality:
  enabled: true
  soul_path: "data/personality/soul.md"     # ships pre-populated in git — do not overwrite it
  interaction_ttl_days: 365
```

`data/personality/soul.md` is committed to git with CyClaw's real personality
already in place — a fresh clone does not need (and should not have) this
file recreated from a placeholder. If you ever delete it, `PersonalityManager`
self-heals with a generic default and a fresh version row, but that's a
recovery path, not the normal first-run state.

---

## MCP Server (Optional — Claude Desktop / Copilot Studio)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cyclaw": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/CyClaw/mcp_hybrid_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server exposes retrieval-only (`hybrid_search` tool). It has no LLM
sampling capability by design.

---

## Beyond the core RAG gateway

This guide only covers `gate.py` + the retrieval pipeline. CyClaw also ships
several opt-in, disabled-by-default, out-of-band layers — none of them
required to get the server above running, and none of them ever imported into
the request path: a GitHub-context/governed-skills **agentic layer**, a
local/SMB **filesystem connector** and read-only **SQL connector**, an
explicitly scoped passive **network connector**, an
optional **NeMo Guardrails** content-safety layer (Phase 2 input + Phase 4a
output grounding when enabled), and an out-of-band **Telegram** channel
(`python -m telegram.cli`, default disabled — design:
[`docs/channels/TELEGRAM_DESIGN.md`](docs/channels/TELEGRAM_DESIGN.md)). See
README for product overview and
[`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) for security scope. A
Docker/`docker-compose` path also exists (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).

For live filesystem metadata, enable `fsconnect`, configure `allowed_roots`,
then rank files without staging them into the RAG corpus:

```bash
python -m agentic.fsconnect.cli largest --root "<configured-root>" --path "<dir>" --top 20 --min-bytes 1048576
```

The walk is read-only, never follows symlinks/reparse points, and reports
`truncated: true` when it reaches `fsconnect.largest_max_entries`.

For passive LAN inventory, first configure a narrow RFC1918 or loopback scope:

```yaml
netconnect:
  enabled: true
  allowed_cidrs: ["192.168.1.0/24"]
```

Then inspect only local metadata or the existing OS neighbor cache:

```bash
python -m agentic.netconnect.cli self
python -m agentic.netconnect.cli arp
```

These commands do not ping, sweep, probe ports, or register a scheduler. Cache
results are hints, not a complete or live reachability map.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `POST /query` returns `503 INDEX_NOT_FOUND` | Run `python -m retrieval.indexer` — index not built yet (see "Is the index really mandatory?" above) |
| `Collection not found in ChromaDB` | Delete the `index/` folder and re-run the indexer |
| LLM timeout on query | Long-context inference is slow on CPU — raise `models.local_llm.timeout_sec` in `config.yaml` (stay under `api.graph_timeout_sec`), or switch to a smaller Ollama model |
| `401` on any `/soul/*` or `/ops/*` endpoint | `CYCLAW_API_KEY` isn't set — see "CYCLAW_API_KEY" above |
| `400` on every request, working server otherwise | Your `Host` header isn't in `config.yaml`'s `allowed_hosts` allow-list — add the hostname/IP you're reaching CyClaw by |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: nltk` (or any other pinned package) | The dependency install (step 3) didn't finish — re-run it; this is not fixed by `nltk.download()` |
| `FileNotFoundError: constraints.txt` | `git pull` — it's a normal tracked file, not a one-time recovery |
| **macOS:** `ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==2.13.0+cpu` | You followed the Linux/Windows torch line. macOS has no `+cpu` wheel — use `pip install "torch==2.13.0"` and the stripped-manifest step ([macOS](#macos-apple-silicon)) |
| **macOS:** torch installs, then `requirements.txt` fails on a torch version conflict | Step 3's manifest stripping was skipped — both manifests hardcode the `+cpu` pin, so they must be filtered ([macOS](#macos-apple-silicon)) |
| **macOS:** `No matching distribution found for torch==2.13.0` (no `+cpu`) | Either an Intel Mac (no `x86_64` wheel exists at this pin) or macOS < 14 (the wheel is `macosx_14_0_arm64`) — see [torch on macOS](#torch-on-macos-plain-build-no-cpu-suffix) |
| **macOS:** `ollama serve` fails with address already in use | The Ollama `.app` is already serving `:11434` — nothing to fix |
| Soul endpoints return 404 | Set `personality.enabled: true` in `config.yaml` |
| `uvloop` install fails on Windows | Expected — uvloop publishes no Windows wheel, so `uvicorn[standard]` simply omits it there and uvicorn falls back to asyncio. Nothing to fix. (uvloop *is* used on Linux and macOS — it is not Linux-only.) |
