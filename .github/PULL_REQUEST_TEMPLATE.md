## Branch naming (required for agent-opened PRs)

Before opening a PR, create the head branch with the **driver-matched** prefix.
Hooks and `utils/agent_identity.py` enforce this allowlist; casual / generic names are not a substitute.

| Driver | Branch pattern | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Claude Code | `claude/<feature>` | `claude/telegram-media-audit` |
| Codex | `codex/<feature>` | `codex/verify-dep-guard` |
| Grok Build | `grok/<feature>` | `grok/pr-template-branch-rules` |
| Kimi / Kimi Code | `kimi/<feature>` | `kimi/docs-sync` |
| CyClaw direct / MCP | `CyClaw/<feature>-<YYYYMMDD>` or `cyclaw/<feature>` | `CyClaw/harness-timeout-20260805` |
| Unknown / generic | `agent/<feature>` | `agent/launcher-browser-parity` |

Rules for agents:
1. Pick the prefix that matches **the tool that is creating the branch**, not a generic label.
2. Do **not** default to `agent/` when the driver is known (Claude → `claude/`, Grok → `grok/`, etc.).
3. `<feature>` must be short, kebab-case, and describe the change (no spaces, no leading `-`).
4. If the branch name is wrong, rename **before** push: `git branch -m <prefix>/<feature>`.

Also allowed by hooks (non-feature): `main`, `dependabot/*`, `renovate/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`.

## Title
**Use this format:**  
`[prefix] - Short descriptive sentence of the change`

**Recommended prefixes (pick the most relevant):**  
`[invariant]` • `[governance]` • `[fsconnect]` • `[agentic]` • `[rag]` • `[security]` • `[docs]` • `[infra]` • `[fix]` • `[feat]`

Example: `[governance] - add two-phase audit + quota enforcement to fsconnect write path`

## Proposed changes
Describe the big picture of your changes here. Explain **why** maintainers should accept this PR.  
If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, link the issue.

**Invariant / Governance Impact** (required for any change touching core paths):
- Which of the 6 security invariants or I6 module isolation does this change affect (or confirm none)?
- Provide evidence it is preserved (e.g., graph topology unchanged, audit convergence maintained, soul evolution still human-gated, RAG-first entry point intact).
- If you are intentionally relaxing or evolving an invariant, explain the justification and compensating controls.

## Types of changes
What types of changes does your code introduce to CyClaw?  
_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_

- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)
- [ ] Invariant / Governance refinement (use this for changes that strengthen or evolve the 6 invariants, I6 isolation, or harness phases)

**Optional free-text scope note** (recommended):  
Core graph/gate/soul path | Out-of-band agentic/fsconnect/sync layer | RAG retrieval/sanitization | Docs + audits | Infrastructure / CI only

---

## Benefits / why
- Why make this change? What is the concrete upside for CyClaw users, operators, or long-term maintainability?
- How does this improve (or at least not degrade) production readiness, invariant strength, offline/air-gapped reliability, governance observability, or security posture?
- For agentic or fsconnect changes: how does this increase governed capability without weakening the read-only core contract?

---

## Risks to monitor
- What are the potential regressions, negative side-effects, or things that need extra attention after merge?
- Could this introduce a new shortcut path around audit convergence, weaken RAG-first enforcement, create network assumptions, affect subprocess isolation, or change soul evolution behavior?
- For write-enablement or quota changes: what failure modes exist if the two-phase audit or trash retention logic has a bug?
- How will you (or future maintainers) detect drift from the intended behavior?

---

## Checklist
_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any item, ask before opening the PR._

- [ ] I have read the latest `docs/CyClaw Architecture Guide` (and any relevant Phase docs) and `SECURITY.md`
- [ ] This change preserves all 6 security invariants and I6 module isolation (explicit evidence or invariant matrix included for core changes)
- [ ] Full sandbox validation has been run (`GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ -q --tb=short`, and `bash .claude/skills/CyClaw-Sandbox/verify.sh` for core RAG/agentic paths) and passes with no regressions
- [ ] No new external network dependencies or mandatory online LLM assumptions were introduced without explicit justification + offline fallback path
- [ ] For any agentic/fsconnect change: two-phase audit, quota enforcement, governed delete/trash, and write guards have been verified
- [ ] Relevant architecture docs or threat model notes have been updated if core behavior or topology changed
- [ ] Commit messages follow the title prefix convention above
- [ ] For large or complex changes: before/after invariant matrix + sandbox evidence is included in "Further comments" or linked

## Further comments
If this is a relatively large, complex, or core-path change, kick off the discussion here in ELI5 technical tone.

**For changes touching `graph.py`, `gate.py`, soul paths, RAG retrieval/sanitization, or agentic subsystems, include:**
- Explicit before/after invariant matrix
- Sandbox validation diff or key evidence
- Any compensating controls or observability added
- A technical summary plus a plain-language (ELI5) summary of what changed, what is at risk, and where to monitor

**Examples of what good "Further comments" look like for core changes:**
- "No change to graph topology or entry points. RAG-first and audit convergence remain enforced by edges only."
- "Added governed write path behind fifth gate + two-phase audit. Core request path untouched. Full sandbox run attached."
- "Relaxed one non-critical logging path for observability; compensating SHA-256 audit still converges. See attached invariant matrix."

---

**Notes for contributors (including solo maintainer / multi-agent PRs):**
- Core invariant or governance changes require the strongest evidence.
- Out-of-band layers (`agentic/`, `sync/`, `.claude/`) may use a lighter checklist, but still need Benefits + Risks + the relevant items.
- Docs-only or audit PRs may skip some technical checklist rows; Benefits and Risks remain required.
- Prefer squash-and-merge. The final squashed commit message is the permanent record; keep intermediate agent WIP out of `main`.
- Be blunt about impact: if invariants, offline posture, or audit behavior are affected, say so explicitly.
