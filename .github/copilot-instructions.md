# Copilot instructions for CyClaw

Trust this file first and only search the repo when these instructions are incomplete or proven wrong.

## What this repo is
- CyClaw is a **Python 3.12** FastAPI RAG server plus a retrieval-only MCP server.
- Core runtime is **offline-first**: FastAPI in `gate.py`, LangGraph policy topology in `graph.py`, hybrid retrieval in `retrieval/`, local LLM via LM Studio, optional Grok fallback only in hybrid mode.
- Repo is mostly Python with small static HTML and shell/PowerShell helpers. Default branch is `main`.
- Main security invariants: retrieval always runs first; graph edges enforce policy; Grok requires hybrid mode + enabled config + per-query confirmation; all paths audit-log; soul changes are explicit human-gated operations.

## High-value files / layout
- `gate.py` — FastAPI app, telemetry kill block, auth/rate-limit, `/query`, `/health`, `/soul*`, static UI mount.
- `graph.py` — 7-node LangGraph state machine; change routing/security behavior here, not in prompts.
- `retrieval/indexer.py` — builds ChromaDB + BM25 indexes from `data/corpus`.
- `retrieval/hybrid_search.py`, `retrieval/embeddings.py`, `retrieval/stemmer.py` — retrieval implementation.
- `llm/client.py` — LM Studio + Grok clients.
- `mcp_hybrid_server.py` — retrieval-only MCP stdio server; **no LLM path**.
- `utils/` — sanitizer, logger, personality, health, errors, rate limiting.
- `sync/` — optional Dropbox/rclone corpus sync; intentionally out-of-band and not imported by `gate.py`/`graph.py`.
- `config.yaml` — single source of truth for ports, model endpoints, retrieval thresholds, prompt-filter patterns, privacy rules, sync settings.
- `tests/` — pytest suite plus `ci_rag_smoke.py` and `apipsTest.ps1`.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/lint/security gates. Match them locally before proposing changes.

## Environment and bootstrap
Always use **Python 3.12**. CI uses 3.12 on Ubuntu and Windows.

## Forbidden Behaviors
- never auto assign yourself to an open PR or merge request and make edits or changes without clear human approval from me (cgrady92) - your job with automated github PRs is to review merge and pull requests to warn me about potential issues beforehand, not to change anything yourself. 
- when a ci check fails more than 5 times in a row, assign yourself and attempt to fix. if you resolve, send a notification and leave a .txt file in the project root to remind me. if unable to resolve, revert any changes you made and notify my by gothub email alerts. 

Recommended clean setup:
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade "pip>=26.1.2"
pip install torch==2.6.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
```
Important:
- **Always install CPU-only torch first**. Otherwise Linux may try to pull the huge CUDA wheel.
- `requirements.txt` alone usually works, but CI’s reproducible install gate uses `constraints.txt`; prefer that for local validation.
- If PyYAML reinstall conflicts in your environment, repo docs note `pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed PyYAML` as a fallback.
- Optional Postgres support exists via `psycopg[binary]`, but default behavior is local-file based.

## Required local prep before running app/tests that touch runtime
Some directories/files are assumed to exist.
```bash
mkdir -p data/personality index logs
printf '# Soul\n' > data/personality/soul.md
export GROK_API_KEY=dummy
```
Notes:
- `GROK_API_KEY` can be any non-empty string in offline mode.
- `gate.py` fails closed for `/soul/*` mutations unless `CYCLAW_API_KEY` is set.
- Server binds to **`127.0.0.1:8787` only**; do not change to `0.0.0.0` unless explicitly asked.

## Build / run
### Build retrieval index
Run this before starting the server if `index/` is missing or corpus changed.
```bash
python -m retrieval.indexer
```
Requirements/preconditions:
- `data/corpus/` must contain `.md` or `.txt` files.
- `data/personality/soul.md` must exist.

Expected outputs:
- ChromaDB at `index/chroma_db`
- BM25 JSON at `index/bm25.json`

If startup says `Index not built`, run the indexer. If Chroma collection format is broken/stale, delete `index/` and rebuild.

### Run FastAPI server
```bash
uvicorn gate:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787
```
or use the declared entry point:
```bash
cyclaw-server
```
Open `/` for the terminal UI, `/health` for readiness.

### Run MCP server
```bash
python mcp_hybrid_server.py
```
or:
```bash
cyclaw-mcp
```
This is retrieval-only by design; do not add sampling/LLM behavior casually.

## Lint / tests / validation
### Fast lint gate (matches PR lint workflow)
```bash
ruff check --select E,F,I,B,C4,S .
```
CI lint only enforces this narrowed rule set, even though `pyproject.toml` has broader Ruff config.

### Main CI-equivalent validation sequence
Run in this order:
```bash
python -m tests.ci_rag_smoke
pytest \
  tests/test_sanitizer.py \
  tests/test_security.py \
  tests/test_rate_limit.py \
  tests/test_audit.py \
  tests/test_client.py \
  tests/test_personality.py \
  tests/test_conftest_fixtures.py \
  tests/test_stemmer.py \
  tests/test_hybrid_search.py \
  tests/test_indexer.py \
  tests/test_embeddings.py \
  tests/test_graph.py \
  tests/test_gate.py \
  tests/test_telemetry_kill.py \
  tests/test_health.py \
  tests/test_mcp_server.py \
  tests/test_metrics.py \
  tests/test_personality_changes.py \
  tests/test_sync_config.py \
  tests/test_sync_filters.py \
  tests/test_sync_runner.py \
  tests/test_sync_cli.py \
  tests/test_sync_scheduler.py \
  tests/test_sync_selftest.py \
  -q --tb=short
```
Why this order:
- It mirrors `ci.yml` and catches index/retrieval regressions before unit tests.
- CI also collects coverage and requires `fail_under = 80` in `pyproject.toml`.

Useful targeted checks:
```bash
bash .claude/skills/run-cyclaw/smoke.sh
python -m pytest tests/ -q
powershell -File tests/apipsTest.ps1   # Windows/manual live-server smoke
```

## CI / workflow facts that matter for PRs
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: main test gate on `main` and `cc`, Python 3.12, Ubuntu + Windows, 30 min timeout. Installs `torch==2.6.0+cpu`, then `pip install -r requirements.txt pytest pytest-cov`, prepares hermetic dirs, runs `tests.ci_rag_smoke`, then the explicit pytest file list.
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml`: PR lint gate for `main`/`cc`; runs only Ruff with `--select E,F,I,B,C4,S`.
- Security workflows exist for CodeQL, OSV, pip-audit, Gitleaks, DevSkim, Defender, Fortify. Avoid introducing secrets, vulnerable deps, telemetry, or unsafe network exposure.
- `pip-audit.yml` and `.osv-scanner.toml` intentionally ignore the accepted ChromaDB CVE because CyClaw uses embedded `PersistentClient`; do not “fix” that policy casually.

## Common gotchas / proven workarounds
- **Do not skip torch-first install**.
- **Do not assume LM Studio is running**. Tests and smoke paths are designed to pass structural flows without it; `/health` may be `degraded` without LM Studio and that can be acceptable if `index_ready` and `graph_ready` are true.
- **Do not edit `constraints.txt` manually** except as documented; regenerate from `requirements.txt` if dependency work requires it.
- `package.json` exists but is effectively unused scaffolding; do not rely on Node tooling for validation.
- `sync/` depends on external `rclone`; tests mock this, but runtime sync features may fail on machines without `rclone` installed.
- Telemetry kill env vars are intentionally set very early in `gate.py`; preserve that ordering before SDK imports.
- `data/personality/soul.md` is authoritative; avoid accidental mutation in tests/scripts.

## Change strategy
- Prefer minimal diffs in the correct subsystem.
- For policy/routing/security behavior, inspect `graph.py` and `gate.py` first.
- For retrieval quality/index errors, inspect `retrieval/` first.
- For soul/versioning/audit behavior, inspect `utils/personality.py` and `utils/logger.py`.
- Before finishing, run at least Ruff + the most relevant pytest targets, and use the full CI-equivalent sequence for risky or cross-cutting changes.
