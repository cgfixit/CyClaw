"""Advanced rail logic tailored to CyClaw soul / personality topics.

The Colang flows in ``config/rails.co`` express *when* a rail fires; the actual
*checks* they call live here as plain, fully-typed, offline-testable Python.
Keeping the logic in Python (rather than only in Colang) means:

  * every check is unit-testable WITHOUT a running LLM or ``nemoguardrails``;
  * the same functions back both the NeMo actions and the CLI ``check``
    subcommand, so the offline heuristics and the live rails never drift.

When ``nemoguardrails`` is installed these functions are also registered as
NeMo actions via :func:`register_actions`; when it is absent, importing this
module still succeeds (the registration decorator is a no-op shim).

This module is NEVER imported by gate.py, graph.py, or mcp_hybrid_server.py.
