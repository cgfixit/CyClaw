"""Detailed, self-contained guardrail metrics -- separate from metrics.py.

By design this layer writes its own JSONL stream (default ``logs/guardrails.jsonl``)
and ships its own analyzer, so the existing ``metrics.py`` / ``GET /audit/summary``
surface is left completely untouched. The two streams can be cross-referenced
later by ``query_hash`` (both use the same ``utils.logger.hash_query``), but the
guardrails stream is the authoritative source for:

  * agentic / tool-call activity            -> event "tool_call"
  * blocked generations (input or output)   -> event "blocked_generation"
  * logged hallucinations (ungrounded)      -> event "hallucination_flagged"
  * individual rail firings                  -> event "rail_triggered"
  * allowed / skipped generations           -> events "generation_allowed" / "guardrail_skipped"

Raw query/answer text is NEVER written -- only SHA-256 hashes, mirroring the
audit log's privacy posture. This module is out-of-band and never imported by
gate.py, graph.py, or mcp_hybrid_server.py.
