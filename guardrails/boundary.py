"""Provider-independent boundary types for the out-of-band guardrails layer.

Phase 1 of issue #1134: typed decisions and provenance only. No brokers,
no NeMo wiring, no request-path imports. Decisions carry hashes and
reason codes -- never raw prompts, context, responses, or tool payloads.

This module is NEVER imported by ``gate.py``, ``graph.py``, or
``mcp_hybrid_server.py`` (I6).

STATUS (verified 2026-09-04): the consumer never arrived. Phases 2a, 3, 4
and 5 of #1134 all shipped and none of them import these types -- Phase 5's
name gate went out as ``utils/tool_broker.py`` (removed 2026-10-10 once PR
#1367 took away its only caller), and ``guardrails/profiles.py``
mirrors the ``GuardrailStage`` values by hand rather than importing them.
Outside its own tests this module has no caller. It is kept deliberately
(owner decision) as the typed vocabulary a future broker would adopt, not
because anything reads it today.
