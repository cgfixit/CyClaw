"""check_otel.py - static validation of CyClaw's telemetry-kill contract.

Usage:
    python3 .claude/skills/otel-hardening/check_otel.py [--repo-root PATH]
                                                        [--strict] [--json]
                                                        [--as-of YYYY-MM-DD]

CyClaw's security contract (issue #1135): unsolicited secondary telemetry and
analytics are disabled before every supported process or telemetry-capable
dependency initializes; intentional policy-gated feature traffic is documented
separately and never mislabeled as telemetry; and no environment variable is
sold as a general network kill switch. The runtime half of that contract is
utils/telemetry_kill.py (canonical maps + build_telemetry_safe_env) plus the
process-boundary delivery surfaces (Docker ENV, launchers, generated
plists/tasks/cron). This checker proves the STATIC half:

  * the production constants still carry EXACTLY the expected name -> value
    pairs (an INDEPENDENT oracle below -- never derived from the production
    module, so deleting or reversing a production value fails here);
  * the scrubbed credential/config names are still all removed;
  * the reference .env, the Docker surfaces, and the launchers still deliver
    the same values;
  * no code path programmatically re-enables what the env pins off;
  * every dependency, provider, executable, connector, scheduled job, and
    process launcher carries an explicit egress classification (category 1-5
    below), so a NEW component cannot land unclassified.

It cannot prove a vendor did not change its telemetry contract in a newer
release -- pin drift and stale review dates surface as WARN, which is the
prompt to re-run the live vendor-doc half (SKILL.md Step 2).

Zero third-party imports (tomllib is stdlib on 3.12) and it NEVER imports
utils.telemetry_kill (AST-parse only), so running it has zero os.environ side
effects and works in a fresh clone before any pip install.

Severity:
    FAIL  a kill-switch invariant actually broke (exit 2).
    WARN  re-verification due (pin drift, stale review date, unclassified
          component, unbounded telemetry-capable transitive) -- exit 0;
          --strict escalates every WARN to a failure.
    INFO  advisory; never affects the exit code.

Exit codes (repo convention):
    0  contract holds (warnings may be present without --strict)
    2  a FAIL check tripped (or a WARN under --strict)
    3  env/config error (a required file missing or unparseable)
