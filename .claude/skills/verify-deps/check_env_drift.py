# Environment-dependency drift checks that live OUTSIDE the four pin manifests.

# dep-guard answers "do the manifests agree with each other." extract_pins.py
# adds "does requirements.txt agree with constraints.txt." Both stop at the
# manifest boundary. This adds the surfaces where an environment dependency is
# real, load-bearing, and recorded NOWHERE a manifest checker looks:
#
#   E1  a tool version pinned inline in a workflow file (flake8, WPS, pip,
#       actionlint, zizmor) -- CI-gating versions with no manifest record
#   E2  the Python version, declared independently in four places
#   E3  a third-party module imported directly by source but declared in no
#       manifest -- the class dep-guard structurally cannot see, because it
#       reads manifests and never reads imports
#   E4  the install-surface SCOPE contract (which surface may carry extras)
#   E5  the Docker build's dependency-install contract, including the
#       fallback torch pre-install held in lock-step with constraints.txt
#   E6  the rest of the Docker surface -- docker-compose.yml, .dockerignore,
#       and publish-ghcr.yml -- agreeing with the Dockerfile and each other
#
# Pure stdlib, no network, no install required -- same constraints dep-guard
# and extract_pins.py hold, so this runs in a fresh clone before pip does.
