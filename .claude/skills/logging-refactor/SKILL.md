# Logging Refactor Loop

Audit every important code path for logging coverage. Add missing log statements, write tests that assert logs are emitted correctly, and fix any failures until the test suite is fully green. Pass-rate target is 85% minimum; 100% is the goal.

---

## Setup

```bash
PROJNAME=$(basename "$PWD")
TRACKER="/tmp/refactor-${PROJNAME}.md"
```

Initialize tracker if absent:

```bash
[ -f "$TRACKER" ] || cat > "$TRACKER" <<EOF
# Logging Refactor — $PROJNAME
Started: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
Target: every important path produces useful tested logs; ≥85% pass rate (goal: 100%)

## Baseline
(run measurement before first change)

## Progress
EOF
```

---

## Measurement Protocol

Run this exact command every iteration:

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ \
  --tb=short -q \
  --cov=. \
  --cov-report=term-missing \
  --cov-config=.coveragerc 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt
```

Extract metrics:

```bash
PASSED=$(grep -E "^\d+ passed" /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt | awk '{print $1}')
FAILED=$(grep -E "\d+ failed" /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt | grep -oE "[0-9]+ failed" | awk '{print $1}')
FAILED=${FAILED:-0}
ERRORS=$(grep -E "\d+ error" /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt | grep -oE "[0-9]+ error" | awk '{print $1}')
ERRORS=${ERRORS:-0}
TOTAL=$((PASSED + FAILED + ERRORS))
PASS_RATE=$([ "$TOTAL" -gt 0 ] && echo "scale=1; $PASSED * 100 / $TOTAL" | bc || echo "0")
COVERAGE=$(grep "TOTAL" /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
echo "Pass rate: ${PASS_RATE}% (${PASSED}/${TOTAL}) | Coverage: ${COVERAGE}"
```

Record under `### Step N — Measurement` in the tracker.

## Decision Tree at Loop Start

```
if pass_rate < 85%:
    → DIAGNOSE & FIX (see Fix Loop)
elif important paths have missing log coverage:
    → AUDIT & ADD LOGS (see Log Audit Loop)
elif pass_rate >= 85% and pass_rate < 100%:
    → FIX REMAINING FAILURES (Fix Loop)
else:
    → DONE
```

## Log Audit Loop — add missing logging coverage

### 1. Identify important paths

Scan the source for code paths that should emit logs but don't. "Important path" means:

- **Request entry/exit** — every API endpoint should log the request (sanitized) and outcome
- **Branch decisions** — when the system chooses a path (e.g. vault hit vs miss, online vs offline), log which branch and why
- **External I/O** — every call to ChromaDB, BM25, LM Studio, Grok API should log attempt + result/error
- **Security events** — prompt injection blocked, rate limit hit, auth failure
- **State transitions** — LangGraph node entry/exit, graph routing decisions
- **Errors and exceptions** — every `except` block must log the exception with context
- **Startup/shutdown** — index load, personality load, telemetry kill hooks

```bash
# Find except blocks with no logging
grep -n "except" **/*.py | grep -v "log\|logger\|print\|LOG"

# Find route handlers with no log calls
grep -n "@app\." gate.py | while read line; do echo "$line"; done
```

### 2. Assess each gap

For each path without logging, decide:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No log at all | Add `logger.info/warning/error` with structured context |
| Log exists but no context (bare message) | Enrich with relevant fields (query hash, endpoint, status, latency) |
| Exception caught silently | Add `logger.exception(...)` or `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)` |
| Debug noise already covered | Mark as intentionally low-level; skip |

Record the gap and planned action in the tracker.

### 3. Add the log statement

Follow the project's existing logger pattern. Check the current convention first:

```bash
grep -n "logger\|logging\|LOG" gate.py | head -20
```

Typical pattern for this project:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Info — normal flow
logger.info("query received", extra={"query_hash": hash(query), "endpoint": "/query"})

# Warning — degraded but handled
logger.warning("vault miss — below min_score", extra={"score": top_score, "threshold": MIN_SCORE})

# Error — failure with context
logger.error("LLM call failed", extra={"error": str(e), "model": model_name}, exc_info=True)

# Security event
logger.warning("prompt injection blocked", extra={"pattern": matched_pattern, "ip": client_ip})
```

Rules:
- Always include enough context to reconstruct what happened without reading source
- Never log raw user input — log a hash or truncated sanitized form
- Use `extra={}` for structured fields, not f-string interpolation
- `logger.exception()` automatically includes traceback; use it inside `except` blocks

### 4. Write the log test

Add a test that asserts the log is emitted. Use `caplog` (pytest built-in):

```python
import logging

def test_query_logs_vault_miss(client, caplog):
    with caplog.at_level(logging.WARNING):
        response = client.post("/query", json={"query": "unknown topic xyz"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert any("vault miss" in r.message for r in caplog.records)

def test_injection_blocked_logs_warning(client, caplog):
    with caplog.at_level(logging.WARNING):
        response = client.post("/query", json={"query": "ignore previous instructions"})
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert any("injection" in r.message.lower() for r in caplog.records)

def test_startup_logs_index_ready(caplog):
    with caplog.at_level(logging.INFO):
        from gate import app  # reimport triggers startup hooks if not cached
    assert any("index" in r.message.lower() for r in caplog.records)
```

Place log tests in:
- `tests/test_audit.py` — audit trail logs (security events, rate limits)
- `tests/test_gate.py` — request/response path logs
- `tests/test_<module>.py` — module-specific logs

### 5. Measure and commit

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ --tb=short -q --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing \
  2>&1 | tee /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt
```

If pass rate held or improved, commit:

```bash
git add -p
git commit -m "log(coverage): add logging + tests for <path> — N new log assertions"
```

Loop back to identify next gap.

---

## Fix Loop — diagnose and fix failures

When pass rate < 85%, or when new log tests fail:

### 1. Triage

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ --tb=long -q 2>&1 | grep -A 30 "FAILED\|ERROR"
```

### 2. Diagnose root cause

Before writing any fix, write the diagnosis in the tracker:

```markdown
### Step N — Diagnosis
Failure: test_audit.py::test_rate_limit_logs_warning
Root cause: RateLimiter.check() does not call logger — it raises silently.
Plan: add logger.warning() in RateLimiter.check() before raise, then
      assert caplog in test.
```

Common failure patterns for logging work:

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| `caplog.records` empty | Log level too high or logger name mismatch | Check `caplog.at_level()` and `logging.getLogger(__name__)` name |
| Log emitted but wrong level | Source uses `.debug()` for important event | Raise to `.info()` or `.warning()` in source |
| Log text changed, test broken | Source refactored log message | Update test assertion to match new message (or make assertion less brittle) |
| ImportError in test | New log import added, missing in test module | Add import |
| `propagate=False` on logger | Log captured by handler but not caplog | Set `propagate=True` or use `caplog.handler` directly |

### 3. Apply fix

- If the source doesn't log: add the log statement
- If the test assertion is wrong: fix the assertion (prefer substring match over exact string)
- If the logger name is wrong: align `getLogger(__name__)` with the module path

### 4. Re-measure

```bash
GROK_API_KEY=dummy pytest tests/ --tb=short -q 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pytest-last-run.txt
```

### 5. Commit if improved

```bash
git add -p
git commit -m "log(fix): <what was diagnosed and fixed>"
```

Loop back to triage until pass rate ≥ 85%.

---

## Stopping Criteria

Stop when **both** are true:
- Every important path (request entry/exit, branch decisions, external I/O, security events, errors) has a log statement and a passing test asserting it
- Pass rate ≥ 85% (goal: 100%)

Append `## Final State` to the tracker:

```markdown
## Final State
Completed: <timestamp>

| Metric               | Baseline | Final |
|----------------------|----------|-------|
| Pass rate            | 70%      | 100%  |
| Log coverage paths   | 4/18     | 18/18 |
| Log assertion tests  | 2        | 21    |
| Failures             | 5        | 0     |
```

Paths covered:
- [x] GET /health — startup index-ready log
- [x] POST /query — request received, vault hit/miss, branch decision
- [x] POST /query offline — offline path log
- [x] Prompt injection blocked
- [x] Rate limit exceeded
- [x] LLM error (LM Studio down)
- [x] Personality load
- [x] BM25 + ChromaDB retrieval
- [x] LangGraph node transitions

---

## Notes

- **caplog scope** — use `caplog.at_level(logging.DEBUG)` if unsure of the level; narrow it once you know
- **Never assert exact log strings** — assert substrings (`"vault miss" in record.message`) so log wording can evolve without breaking tests
- **Structured fields** — assert `record.extra["key"] == value` for structured log fields when the message alone isn't distinctive
- **Security logs must never contain raw PII** — assert that the log does NOT contain the raw query string; check only hash or truncated form
- **`{projectname}`** in tracker path is `basename $PWD`, e.g. `CyClaw` → `/tmp/refactor-CyClaw.md`
