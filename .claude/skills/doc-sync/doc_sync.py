"""doc_sync.py – detect drift between CyClaw's code/config and its docs.

Usage:
    python .claude/skills/doc-sync/doc_sync.py [--repo-root PATH] [--json]

Code is the source of truth; docs are derived. This script extracts facts from
code/config and checks that the docs that cite them agree. It reports drift; it
NEVER edits anything. Fixing docs is a human/agent judgment call (and behavior
must never be changed to match a stale doc — see the SKILL).

Checks:
    D1  Skills on disk        every .claude/skills/<name> appears in the CLAUDE.md skills table
    D2  Console entry points  pyproject [project.scripts] names appear in CLAUDE.md
    D3  Config numbers        port / min_score / rrf_k / graph_timeout_sec / soul_max_chars
                              cited in CLAUDE.md match config.yaml
    D4  Banned-pattern count  the real banned_patterns length matches the "<n> patterns"
                              claims across CLAUDE.md, config.yaml, guardrails, fsconnect
    D5  Route table           gate.py @app routes are all named in CLAUDE.md
    D6  Hook claims           doc claims about a "stop hook" are backed by .claude/settings.json,
                              across CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and .claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md
    D7  M5 doctrine           docs/m5-48gb-coding-expectations.md cites the shipped
                               local model tag, Ollama context budget, and timeout values
    D8  Graph node count      the real graph.py add_node() count matches every "<n>-node"
                              claim across the docs and agent-facing prompt files
    D9  README paths          multi-segment repo paths cited in any README.md resolve
                              to a real file (or a documented absence)
    D10 README links          relative markdown links resolve, and same-file "#anchor"
                              links match a real heading under GitHub's slug rule
    D11 README modules        every "python -m <module>" in a README resolves to a real
                              module, or is a known external runner

Exit codes (repo convention):
    0  no drift detected
    2  drift detected (items to reconcile)
    3  env/config error

# 2026-09-11 README drift sweep and ported here so the next pass is mechanical.

# security control described backwards, an over-broad "retired" banner, a
# module missing from the module map), which no path resolver can see. These
# are regression guards, not bug-finders. That is worth stating because the
# temptation with a quiet check is to "improve" it into a noisy one.
