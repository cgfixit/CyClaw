name: doc-sync
description: Detect and reconcile drift between CyClaw's code/config (the source of truth) and its documentation — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README, config comments, command docs, and skill tables. Runs a deterministic checker for the mechanical facts (skills list, entry points, config numbers, route table, pattern count, hook claims) and drives a manual pass for prose claims. Use after any architecture/config/skill change, before a release, or when asked to reconcile the docs.

# Doc Sync

**Persona:** You are the technical editor who keeps CyClaw's docs honest. The
rule is absolute: **code is the source of truth; docs are derived.** When a doc
and the code disagree, the doc is wrong — you fix the doc. You NEVER change code
behavior to match a stale doc; if a doc describes behavior the code should have
but doesn't, that is a code decision for the user, not a doc edit. Drift is not
cosmetic here: this repo found a command doc (`check-soul.md`) that falsely
claimed the server won't boot without `soul.md` (it self-heals) and pointed at a
`soul_hash` constant that doesn't exist — a weaker agent following it would
report a healthy server as broken.

**Why it matters:** the repo carries two agent manuals (`CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md`), a README, config comments, command docs, and a skills table — six
places one fact can rot. Nothing checks them against the code.

---

## Run

### Step 1 — Deterministic checker (no heavy deps)

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/doc-sync/doc_sync.py
```

Needs only PyYAML. It extracts facts from code/config and flags docs that cite
them wrongly. Exit `0` no drift · `2` drift found · `3` env error.

| ID | Fact (source of truth) | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Every skill on disk appears in the CLAUDE.md skills table |
| D2 | `pyproject [project.scripts]` | Every console entry point is named in CLAUDE.md |
| D3 | `config.yaml` | `port`/`min_score`/`rrf_k`/`graph_timeout_sec`/`soul_max_chars` cited in CLAUDE.md match the real values |
| D4 | `banned_patterns` length | The "`<n>` patterns" claim is consistent across CLAUDE.md, config.yaml, guardrails, fsconnect |
| D5 | `gate.py`/`gate_ops.py`/`gate_auth.py`/`gate_memory.py` `@app` routes | Every API route is named in CLAUDE.md, and `setup-guide.md`'s REST section matches (both directions: undocumented and phantom routes) |
| D6 | `.claude/settings.json` hooks | A "stop hook" claim is either backed by a wired Stop hook or accurately attributed to the session runtime |
| D7 | `config.yaml` + `macos/ollama-mlx.env` | `docs/m5-48gb-coding-expectations.md` cites the shipped local model tag, `max_tokens`, timeouts, `max_context_tokens`, and `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. Citation only; the no-stall inequality lives in config-guard C12 and `tests/test_m5_ollama_runtime_contract.py` |
| D8 | `graph.py` `add_node()` calls (AST-counted) | Every "`<n>`-node"/"`<n>` nodes" claim across CLAUDE.md, docs, and agent-facing prompt files matches the real count. Excludes approximate ("`~10` nodes") sizing advice and version-pinned snapshot docs |
| D9 | Files on disk | Every multi-segment repo path cited in any README resolves. Bare filenames are out of scope on purpose (a `falco.yaml` in prose is the container image's own file), as are runtime artifacts (`logs/`, `index/`) and paths the doc itself marks as deleted/excluded/not-yet-generated |
| D10 | Link targets + headings | Relative markdown links in READMEs resolve, and same-file `#anchor` links match a real heading under **GitHub's** slug rule — spaces become hyphens one-for-one and are never collapsed, so `## macOS launchd & Keychain` is `#macos-launchd--keychain` with a double hyphen |
| D11 | Modules on disk | Every `python -m <module>` in a README resolves to a real module or package, or is a known external runner (`pytest`, `pip`, `venv`, …) |

### Step 2 — Reconcile each mechanical drift item

For every `DRIFT` line, edit the DERIVED doc to match the source of truth. One
commit per doc family (all CLAUDE.md fixes together, all README fixes together)
keeps the history reviewable. Examples of the fix direction:
- D1 → add the missing skill row to the CLAUDE.md skills table.
- D3 → replace the stale number in CLAUDE.md with the config value (never edit
  config to match the doc).
- D5 → add the missing route to the CLAUDE.md request-flow/route section.
- D6 → reword the doc to say the enforcement is applied by the session runtime
  (not wired in repo `settings.json`), OR wire the hook if that is the intent —
  the latter is a settings change, so confirm with the user first.
- D8 → replace the stale node-count claim with the real `graph.py` count
- D9 → fix the path, or say plainly in the doc that the file is gone (the checker reads "deleted"/"removed"/"excluded"/"not yet generated" as a deliberate absence)
- D10 → repoint the link, or fix the anchor to match the heading's real GitHub slug
- D11 → correct the module path, or add a genuinely-external runner to `_D11_EXTERNAL` in `doc_sync.py` **with a reason**
  (never edit `graph.py` to match the doc).

### Step 3 — Manual pass for prose claims the checker can't parse

The checker covers structured facts. Read these source→doc pairs by hand and
correct any claim the code contradicts:

- **Command docs (`.claude/commands/*.md`) vs actual behavior** — the highest-
  risk drift class (the `check-soul.md` example). For each command doc, confirm
  every behavioral claim ("the server will…", "look for constant X") against the
  code path it describes.
- **Boot/failure semantics** in CLAUDE.md "Environment Quirks" — verify against
  `gate.py`/`utils/personality.py`: soul.md self-heals; a missing index is a
  503 fail-soft, not a crash; `require_env` is decorative.
- **AGENTS.md ↔ CLAUDE.md** — the two manuals must not contradict each other on
  invariants, install steps, or the current project mode.
- **Two memory systems / two session-note locations** — `.claude/memory/` is
  legacy; `docs/memories/` is live. Docs should point at the live one.
- **THREAT_MODEL.md control table** vs the code that implements each control
  (sanitizer at `/query`, TrustedHostMiddleware, triple-gate) — controls should
  not be described that the code no longer has, or vice versa.

### Step 4 — Report

Produce a table: `drift item → source of truth → doc fixed (or "flagged to
user" for behavior questions)`. Anything that would require a CODE change to
resolve goes to the user as a question, never as a silent doc edit that hides
the mismatch.

---

## Verify

```bash
bash .claude/skills/doc-sync/verify.sh
```

Confirms the checker runs on the live tree (drift there is expected and does not
fail the check) and passes a detection self-test: it builds a stub CLAUDE.md
missing real skills/routes and asserts the checker flags drift (exit 2). A
drift-checker that can't detect planted drift is useless; the self-test keeps it
honest. Skips cleanly if PyYAML is absent.

## Known drift baseline (this session, 2026-07)

Seed list so the first run has context — reconcile these:

1. **`ponytail` skill** on disk, absent from the CLAUDE.md skills table (D1).
2. **`/audit/summary`, the four `/ops/*`, and `/soul/*` sub-routes** exist in
   `gate.py` but were missing from the CLAUDE.md route map (D5).
3. **"stop hook" claims** in CLAUDE.md/PROJECT_RULES reference a hook not wired
   in `.claude/settings.json`; the committer-email + force-push enforcement is
   applied by the session runtime — say so, or wire it (D6).
4. **`check-soul.md`** (fixed this session) claimed soul.md is required to boot
   and referenced a nonexistent `soul_hash` constant.
5. **`session-start-sync-check.sh`** was wired as a second `SessionStart` hook on
   2026-09-04; docs still saying "if wired" or "not registered" are now the stale
   side. The same change unwired a `UserPromptSubmit` hook pointing at a deleted
   script — a hook path that does not resolve is a drift class worth checking.
6. **The session-notes pointer moved.** The live path is
   `docs/work/SESSION_NOTES.md` (still an empty scaffold, but it is the
   sanctioned destination per `CLAUDE.md` §7/§10). Neither `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md`
   nor `.claude/session-notes/` exists — align any doc still naming either.

## Guardrails

- **Code wins, always.** Fix docs, not behavior. A doc that describes desired-
  but-absent behavior is a user decision — flag it, don't "make it true" by
  editing config or code under the guise of a doc sync.
- **Never edit `config.yaml` values, graph edges, or code to silence a drift
  line.** D3/D4/D5/D7/D8 drift is fixed in the doc, not the source.
- Wiring a hook (to resolve D6 by making the claim true) is a `settings.json`
  change — confirm with the user first.

## Gotchas

- **The checker is fact-scoped.** It cannot read prose intent — Step 3's manual
  pass is where command-doc and semantics drift is caught.
- **D3 only flags a WRONG cited number, not an undocumented one.** Not every
  tunable must be in CLAUDE.md; the check fires only when the doc discusses a key
  but shows a value that no longer matches config.
- **D9/D10/D11 are regression guards, not bug-finders.** On the tree they were written against (the 2026-09-11 README sweep) all three found *zero* true positives. The real drift that sweep caught was prose-level — a security control described backwards, an over-broad "retired" banner, a module missing from the module map — and no path resolver can see any of that. Step 3's manual pass is still where the findings come from; these three only stop a rename from rotting a reference unnoticed. Resist "improving" them into noisy checks: the hand-run versions produced 13 false positives before the scoping rules above were added, and a checker that fires on a healthy tree gets ignored within a week.
- **D7 is citation presence, not arithmetic.** It does not prove
  `max_context_tokens + max_tokens + 1500 <= OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. That
  relationship is C12 (FAILs when `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` is below the RAG
  floor); the pytest contract still owns CI-blocking arithmetic.
- **D4 ignores small numbers** (<6) to avoid matching unrelated "3 patterns"
  phrasing; it targets the documented set size.
- **Run it after, not before, a rename.** If you rename a skill or route, the
  checker will (correctly) flag the old name in docs until you update them.
