# `.claude/` — Project Skills & Workflows

Quick reference for Claude Code assistance patterns in CyClaw.

## Skills

The skills directory holds many more skills than the handful below (operational,
refactor-loop, memory, and agent skills). For the **authoritative, complete list**, see the
**"Available Skills (main branch)"** table in the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — kept in
sync there so a second list does not drift. A few common entry points:

```bash
/invariant-guard         # Static-assert the six security invariants (stdlib)
/config-guard            # Static-validate config.yaml's relational/value/threat-model contract
/dep-guard               # Static-validate dependency-pin invariants (pyproject + constraints)
/run-cyclaw              # Smoke-test the FastAPI server
/architecture-refactor   # Start architecture refactor loop
/tests-refactor          # Start test coverage loop
/logging-refactor        # Start logging audit loop
/speed-refactor          # Start speed optimization loop
/wrap-up                 # Run end-of-session checklist
/CyClaw-Optimize         # there are many more, verify folder each time
```

The three static guards — `/invariant-guard` (topology & imports), `/config-guard`
(config.yaml numbers & relations), `/dep-guard` (dependency pins) — are the
pre-merge/pre-install checks; each ships a `check_*.py` plus a `verify.sh` that
CI runs automatically. See the authoritative table in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) §9.

## Refactor Loop Pattern

All `*-refactor` skills follow the same seven-step cycle:

1. **Measure** — baseline the current state (tests, latency, log coverage)
2. **Assess** — identify the highest-leverage gap
3. **Execute** — make one focused change
4. **Test** — verify correctness via smoke test or pytest
5. **Commit** — commit with a clear message
6. **Track** — record progress in `/tmp/refactor-CyClaw.md`
7. **Loop** — repeat until all stopping criteria are met

## Key Conventions

- Skill folders: `kebab-case`, matching `name:` in SKILL.md frontmatter
- All SKILL.md files use YAML frontmatter: `name:`, `description:`
- Refactor progress is tracked in `/tmp/refactor-CyClaw.md`
- Git identity must be set before commits: `git config user.email noreply@anthropic.com`
