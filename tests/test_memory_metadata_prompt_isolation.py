"""A fact's `category` and `tags` must never reach an LLM prompt.

`memory/store.py` scans only the fact BODY for injection -- advisory on propose
(`:497`), enforcing on apply (`:589`) -- so `category` and `tags` are
authenticated-caller free text that no scanner ever inspects. `category` is not
even shape-validated the way `tags` is (`policy.check_tags`); it is silently
truncated to 64 chars at insert. A metadata-only `update_fact` (content omitted)
runs no scan of any kind, because the apply path guards on
``if content is not None``.

That is only safe because neither field is ever rendered into prompt context.
The fusion adapter reads the body and the integer id and nothing else, and
`graph._format_context_chunks` -- the single context builder behind local_llm,
both external-provider paths and offline_best_effort -- interpolates only
`source`, `score` and `text`.

Nothing pinned that. These tests do, at both hops, so the day someone widens the
adapter to carry metadata the unscanned-field problem stops being theoretical and
starts being a failing test. They deliberately assert the *absence* of a planted
sentinel rather than the shape of the current payload: an assertion about what
reaches the model survives refactors of how it gets there.

Scope note: the residual these tests do NOT close is FTS retrieval steering.
`category` and `tags` are indexed columns (`store.py:168-173`), so stuffing them
with keywords can make a fact surface for a query its body would not match. That
steers WHICH already-enforced body text is retrieved; it injects no text of its
own, and it grants an authenticated caller nothing they lack via `add_fact`.
