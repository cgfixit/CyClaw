"""Real, unmocked execution tests for sync.scheduler.LaunchdScheduler
(Darwin-only backend).

test_launchd_scheduler.py proves this class's LOGIC by mocking
platform.system, Path.home, and (for status()/remove()) subprocess.run --
deliberately, for host-independent coverage -- but it never actually invokes
the real launchctl binary, and never round-trips a plist through the real
plistlib.dump/load path on a real macOS host.

This file is the opposite: every test here skips cleanly unless the host
really is Darwin (sys.platform == "darwin" unmodified -- no monkeypatching
of platform.system or subprocess anywhere in this module), and then
exercises install()/status()/remove() for real. Only Path.home is
redirected to tmp_path, so the runner's actual ~/Library/LaunchAgents is
never touched.

install() never calls launchctl at all (by design -- see the class's own
docstring: "generate, don't auto-enroll"), so no persistent LaunchAgent is
ever loaded into the real launchd here. status()'s and remove()'s launchctl
calls both tolerate "not loaded"/"no such process" as an expected outcome --
exactly what they see in these tests, since nothing here is ever
bootstrapped. Same real-vs-mocked split as test_fsconnect_macos_real.py
draws for agentic/fsconnect/pathsafe.py.

    This test bootstraps the real generated plist for real (bypassing

    RunAtLoad: False and a fixed StartCalendarInterval (see _make_cfg), so it
    never actually executes sync.cli; the finally block unconditionally
    boots it out even if an assertion above raises, so no test LaunchAgent
    is ever left registered on the real runner.
