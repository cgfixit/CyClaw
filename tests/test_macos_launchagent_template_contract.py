"""Contract for the hand-editable macOS LaunchAgent templates + the launcher.

These templates are the documented fallback for operators who do not use the
generators (``telegram.cli poll-plist`` / ``health-plist`` /
``fsconnect.cli trash-empty-plist``), which resolve a real interpreter via
``utils.launchd_plist.python_executable()``. The templates cannot resolve
anything, so every interpreter they name must be an obvious placeholder --
launchd hands a job a minimal PATH and macOS has shipped no ``/usr/bin/python``
since 12.3, so a bare ``python`` in ProgramArguments is a silent no-op.

Deliberately a separate module from tests/test_macos_scripts.py: that file is
being edited concurrently (PR #928) and these assertions are about a different
contract -- the templates' *executability*, not the uninstaller's label list.
