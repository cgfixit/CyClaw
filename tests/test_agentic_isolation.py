"""Invariant guard: the agentic layer must stay out of the request path.

The whole security argument for the agentic layer is that it is out-of-band --
exactly like sync/. If gate.py, graph.py, or mcp_hybrid_server.py ever imported
``agentic``, the layer would be coupled into the request path and could (in
principle) influence retrieval, routing, or the MCP surface. This test fails
loudly if that coupling is ever introduced.
