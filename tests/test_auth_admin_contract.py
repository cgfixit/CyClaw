"""Contract tests for static/auth_admin.js — the shared Users admin panel.

Deliberately its own file rather than an append to test_terminal_contract.py:
auth_admin.js is its own component (terminal.html loads it as a separate
script), not part of the terminal console's route contract, and keeping it separate
means a PR touching this panel does not collide at EOF with a PR touching the
terminal contract tests.

Source-reading, like its sibling: these assert the shape of the client code,
because the failure they guard against is invisible to any server-side test.
