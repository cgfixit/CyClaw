"""Real, unmocked execution tests for agentic.fsconnect.pathsafe's macOS-only
policy helpers.

test_fsconnect_macos_policy.py proves these functions' LOGIC by forcing
``sys.platform == "darwin"`` (via monkeypatch) and faking ``os.stat`` results
regardless of the host OS running the suite -- that is deliberate and valuable
for host-independent coverage, but it never actually executes the Darwin
branch on a real Darwin kernel with real filesystem state.

This file is the opposite: every test here either (a) skips cleanly unless
the host really is Darwin (``sys.platform == "darwin"`` unmodified -- no
monkeypatching of ``sys.platform``, ``os.stat``, or ``os.close`` anywhere in
this module), and then exercises the real function against real files/dirs
created under ``tmp_path`` or a test-owned mounted APFS disk image, or (b) for
the one genuinely platform-independent property (case-insensitive filesystem
identity), uses a runtime filesystem probe instead of guessing from
``sys.platform`` -- the same technique
``_is_real_descendant``'s own docstring explains and that
``test_fsconnect_pathsafe.py``'s ``_tmp_is_case_sensitive`` helper already
uses elsewhere in this suite.

On this Linux sandbox (and any non-Darwin CI runner) the Darwin-only tests
below skip rather than run a simulation -- there is nothing to fake here, by
design. They only produce real signal on an actual Mac.

No SF_DATALESS / iCloud-dataless coverage lives here on purpose. A genuine
dataless placeholder requires live iCloud Drive sync state -- a file that has
actually been evicted to the cloud by the OS after real account sign-in and
real sync activity -- which cannot be created deterministically, or often at
all, on a fresh CI runner with no iCloud account configured. This file does
not attempt to fake that condition for real (setting ``st_flags`` by hand on
a real file is not the same claim as a real eviction). ``_is_macos_dataless``
therefore has exactly one source of truth in this repository:
``test_fsconnect_macos_policy.py``'s
``test_dataless_flag_is_authoritative_regardless_of_logical_size`` -- and that
coverage should be read as simulated-only, never as proof against a real
iCloud-evicted file.
