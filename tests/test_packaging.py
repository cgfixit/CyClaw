"""Static regression guard for pyproject.toml's wheel/sdist build targets.

Verified empirically (2026-08-09): hatchling's `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages` only pulls in directory packages. Top-level single-file modules added
to a plain `include` list were silently dropped from the built wheel -- only
`force-include` (an explicit source->destination mapping) actually worked. A
real `pip install cyclaw` from a wheel (e.g. the one python-publish.yml builds
on every GitHub Release) raised `ModuleNotFoundError` for gate/gate_ops/
gate_auth/gate_memory/graph/mcp_hybrid_server/metrics -- every [project.scripts]
entry point except the ones rooted at an already-packaged directory. `pip
install -e .` (the documented dev path) was unaffected: its .pth-based editable
mechanism points at the repo root directly and never consults this config.

This test is deliberately static (tomllib only, no real hatchling build) so it
runs in the same no-deps-installed environment as the rest of the unit suite.
