"""Live Postgres-backend tests for utils.ratelimit.RateLimiter.

These exercise the Postgres write-through persistence path (the `# pragma`-style
branches that need a real server). They are SKIPPED unless CYCLAW_DB_URL points at
a reachable Postgres — so the default offline suite stays green with zero extra
deps, and the dedicated `postgres-backend` CI job runs them for real.

Imports only utils.ratelimit (no gate/fastapi) so the file collects in a minimal
Postgres CI environment.
