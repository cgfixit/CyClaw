"""Lock the .emb_cache actions/cache step onto every CI job that can trigger it.

retrieval/embeddings.py fetches the sentence-transformers embedding model
(~90MB) from HuggingFace on a cold cache. Any job step that runs
`python -m retrieval.indexer` -- directly, or indirectly via the
CyClaw-Sandbox skill's verify.sh -- pays that fetch unless the job also caches
`.emb_cache` under the shared `emb-model-<model>-v<n>` key.

ci.yml's `test` job and python-package-conda.yml's `ci` job have always had
this cache step. ci.yml's `verify-skills` matrix job runs the CyClaw-Sandbox
leg's verify.sh (which calls `python -m retrieval.indexer`) but did not cache
`.emb_cache` -- only the unrelated torch-wheel cache -- so every matrix
invocation of that leg re-downloaded the model fresh. This is the same class
of gap `test_ci_coverage_flag_contract.py` closes for `--cov=` enumeration,
applied to this cache step instead.
