The console is a static file served by the gateway itself, so nothing ties its
fetch() targets to gate.py's registered routes: a renamed or removed endpoint
only fails at runtime in a browser, invisible to pytest and CI. These tests
extract every gateway path the console calls — direct `${API}/...` fetch
targets plus callOps('/ops/...') invocations — and assert each one exists on
gate.app with the HTTP method the console uses.
