"""Tests for agentic.fsconnect.osutil.reveal -- root-scope containment (POSIX).

Exercises the REAL reveal() logic (existence check, root containment, argv launch)
with only subprocess.run / shutil.which stubbed. Previously the sole reveal test
replaced the whole function body, so the scope check was never exercised.
