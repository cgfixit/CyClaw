"""Real (non-mocked) offline RAG smoke test for CI.

Unlike a fully-mocked smoke (a hardcoded MockRetriever that returned a constant
dict), this exercises the *actual* retrieval stack end to end:

  1. Build a real ChromaDB (semantic) + BM25 (keyword) index from data/corpus
     via retrieval.indexer.build_index().
  2. Instantiate the real HybridRetriever and run real hybrid_search() calls for
     several questions the committed corpus (data/corpus/cyclaw_overview.md)
     answers.
  3. Assert every query returns a hit whose fused score clears the configured
     retrieval.min_score gate (the 0.028 "vault hit" threshold from config.yaml)
     AND lands on the expected source doc -- i.e. the same path that the
     static/terminal.html /query endpoint exercises for a real RAG reply.

The min_score is read from config.yaml (NOT hardcoded) so the assertion tracks
the real gate and cannot silently drift if the threshold is retuned.

Queries are deliberately phrased close to the committed corpus headings so they
land well above the gate at stable CI runtime -- this is a regression smoke,
not a recall-tuning benchmark.

No LLM is involved: CI has no LM Studio, so this stops at retrieval (the part
ChromaDB + BM25 + RRF actually own). Generation is covered separately by the
gate/graph unit tests with a mocked LLM.

Exit non-zero on any failure so the CI step goes red on a real retrieval regression.
