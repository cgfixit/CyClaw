"""Tests for the first-run index-build routes (POST /index/build, GET /index/status).

A missing index has always been fail-soft -- /query answers 503
INDEX_NOT_FOUND rather than crashing -- but the only way out was a CLI command
plus a process restart. These routes let the console recover from first-run in
place, so they are the one path a brand-new operator is guaranteed to touch.

The real build cannot run here: it needs the sentence-transformers model, which
tests/conftest.py mocks away and CI has no network for. So build_index is
patched throughout and the assertions are about the STATE MACHINE and the
GATES -- which is where the risk actually is (a concurrent second build
corrupts the index; a non-loopback caller must not be able to start one).
