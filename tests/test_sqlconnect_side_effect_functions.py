"""The read-only SQL guard must also refuse functions that reach outside the DB.

assert_read_only_sql's leading-keyword gate, single-statement check and
read-only session all judge a statement by what it does *to the database*. A
plain SELECT can still call server-side functions whose effect is on the DB
HOST -- reading its filesystem, opening an outbound connection, or parking a
backend -- and none of the existing gates see any of it.

These are read-only-from-the-database's-point-of-view, which is exactly why
they need to be named explicitly rather than inferred.

# ── unicode-escaped identifiers (U&"...") ────────────────────────────────────
# Postgres un-escapes U&"pg_\0072ead_file" into the plain identifier
# pg_read_file BEFORE the grammar runs, so the escaped spelling calls exactly the
# same built-in. _FORBIDDEN_FN_RE scans the RAW identifier text, so it saw
# "pg_\0072ead_file" and pg_read_\w+ never matched — every forbidden side-effect
# function above was reachable this way.
#
# Verified against a live PostgreSQL 16, not inferred:
#   SELECT U&"pg_\0072ead_file"('/etc/passwd', 0, 60)  -> root:x:0:0:root:/root...
#   SELECT pg_catalog.U&"pg_\0072ead_file"('/etc/hostname') -> vm
# The schema-qualified form executes too, which is why the prefix check does not
# treat a preceding "." as "this u belongs to a larger name".
#
# The fix refuses the U& prefix outright rather than decoding it, matching the
# E'...' rule in the same function. Decoding would mean reimplementing Postgres's
# UIDENT rules exactly — \XXXX and \+XXXXXX, surrogate pairs, and a UESCAPE clause
# that redefines the escape character — and any gap in that decoder is a fresh
# bypass. A read-only preview never needs a unicode-escaped name.
