"""Tests for the harness console's agentic coding routes (P9).

Three routes wrap ``agentic.cli``'s real-repo run/status/decide subcommands
through ``utils.ops_runner`` -- the only channel invariant I6 allows between
``harness/`` and ``agentic/``. What these tests pin, in order of how much
damage getting it wrong would do:

* the browser can never supply a command to execute (``harness/agent_policy.py``
  maps a profile NAME to a fixed argv; nothing in the request body reaches
  ``subprocess``),
* the constants duplicated out of ``agentic/`` to satisfy I6 still match their
  originals,
* every failure mode reaches the console in the one error envelope
  ``static/harness.html``'s fetch helper can read,
* a non-zero CLI exit stays an HTTP 200 carrying ``ok=false`` -- the shim
  succeeded, the subprocess it ran did not, and the console distinguishes them.

The shim itself is stubbed throughout: these assert the route contract, not
``utils/ops_runner.py`` (``tests/test_ops_runner.py`` owns that) and not the
loop (``tests/test_agentic_real_repo_loop.py`` owns that).
