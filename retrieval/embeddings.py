"""Local embedding service using sentence-transformers.

No Ollama. No external service required. The embedding model's device is
hardcoded to CPU -- see EMBED_DEVICE below for why this is pinned rather than
auto-selected.
Caches the model AND the parsed config across calls to avoid reload/reparse
overhead on the hot query path.

Security note (2026-06):
- We delegate model loading to sentence-transformers.
- Prefer safetensors format for any custom or local models.
- Historical: CVE-2025-32434 showed that torch.load(..., weights_only=True) was bypassable for RCE on torch<2.6.0.
- We now pin torch==2.13.0+cpu (see pyproject.toml) and treat untrusted .pth/.bin files as high risk.
- Model weights should come from verified/trusted sources only (HF official or local hashed files).

    Deliberately checks ONLY the BM25 sidecar, not ``indexing.chroma_path`` --
    a prior version of this function also treated an existing Chroma
    directory as "present," which was a real bug (caught in review):
    ``retrieval.indexer.build_index()`` calls ``_ChromaWriter.reset()``,

    an operator's own pre-set stricter value (present before this process
    started, i.e. before the latch) is honored, which still works correctly.
